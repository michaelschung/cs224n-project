sociologist james a. beckford , in his 1975 study of jehovah 's witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of god 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that jehovah 's witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .
the geologic record of the proterozoic ( 2,500 to 541 million years ago ) is more complete than that for the preceding archean . in contrast to the deep-water deposits of the archean , the proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas ; furthermore , many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than archean-age ones , and plenty are unaltered . study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive , rapid continental accretion ( unique to the proterozoic ) , supercontinent cycles , and wholly modern orogenic activity . roughly 750 million years ago , the earliest-known supercontinent rodinia , began to break apart . the continents later recombined to form pannotia , 600–540 ma .
ottoman turkish was the official language of the empire . it was an oghuz turkic language highly influenced by persian and arabic . the ottomans had several influential languages : turkish , spoken by the majority of the people in anatolia and by the majority of muslims of the balkans except in albania and bosnia ; persian , only spoken by the educated ; arabic , spoken mainly in arabia , north africa , iraq , kuwait , the levant and parts of the horn of africa ; and somali throughout the horn of africa . in the last two centuries , usage of these became limited , though , and specific : persian served mainly as a literary language for the educated , while arabic was used for religious rites .
madonna 's use of sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism . as roger chapman documents in culture wars : an encyclopedia of issues , viewpoints , and voices , volume 1 ( 2010 ) , she has drawn frequent condemnation from religious organizations , social conservatives and parental watchdog groups for her use of explicit , sexual imagery and lyrics , religious symbolism , and otherwise " irreverent " behavior in her live performances . the times wrote that she had " started a revolution amongst women in music ... her attitudes and opinions on sex , nudity , style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice . " professor john fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self , of sexuality , and of one 's social relations . in doing gender in media , art and culture ( 2009 ) , the authors noted that madonna , as a female celebrity , performer , and pop icon , is able to unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates . according to lesbian feminist sheila jeffreys , madonna represents woman 's occupancy of what monique wittig calls the category of sex , as powerful , and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corvée allotted to women . professor sut jhally has referred to madonna as " an almost sacred feminist icon . "
the group changed their name to destiny 's child in 1996 , based upon a passage in the book of isaiah . in 1997 , destiny 's child released their major label debut song " killing time " on the soundtrack to the 1997 film , men in black . the following year , the group released their self-titled debut album , scoring their first major hit " no , no , no " . the album established the group as a viable act in the music industry , with moderate sales and winning the group three soul train lady of soul awards for best r & b/soul album of the year , best r & b/soul or rap new artist , and best r & b/soul single for " no , no , no " . the group released their multi-platinum second album the writing 's on the wall in 1999 . the record features some of the group 's most widely known songs such as " bills , bills , bills " , the group 's first number-one single , " jumpin ' jumpin ' " and " say my name " , which became their most successful song at the time , and would remain one of their signature songs . " say my name " won the best r & b performance by a duo or group with vocals and the best r & b song at the 43rd annual grammy awards . the writing 's on the wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide . during this time , beyoncé recorded a duet with marc nelson , an original member of boyz ii men , on the song " after all is said and done " for the soundtrack to the 1999 film , the best man .
through the influence of the eusebian faction at constantinople , an arian bishop , george of cappadocia , was now appointed to rule the see of alexandria . athanasius , after remaining some days in the neighbourhood of the city , finally withdrew into the desert of upper egypt , where he remained for a period of six years , living the life of the monks , devoting himself to the composition of a group of writings ; " apology to constantius " , the " apology for his flight " , the " letter to the monks " , and the " history of the arians " .
in march 2008 , it was announced that avicenna 's name would be used for new directories of education institutions for health care professionals , worldwide . the avicenna directories will list universities and schools where doctors , public health practitioners , pharmacists and others , are educated . the project team stated " why avicenna ? avicenna ... was ... noted for his synthesis of knowledge from both east and west . he has had a lasting influence on the development of medicine and health sciences . the use of avicenna 's name symbolises the worldwide partnership that is needed for the promotion of health services of high quality . "
the root system and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food , and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system . cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots . stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots . roots that spread out close to the surface , such as those of willows , can produce shoots and ultimately new plants . in the event that one of the systems is lost , the other can often regrow it . in fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf , as is the case with saintpaulia , or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus ( a mass of unspecialised cells ) that can grow into a new plant . in vascular plants , the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots . roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch , as in sugar beets and carrots .
having produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with , the next stage is to translate this into a schema that implements the relevant data structures within the database . this process is often called logical database design , and the output is a logical data model expressed in the form of a schema . whereas the conceptual data model is ( in theory at least ) independent of the choice of database technology , the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen dbms . ( the terms data model and database model are often used interchangeably , but in this article we use data model for the design of a specific database , and database model for the modelling notation used to express that design . )
the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer . the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain . grain is malted by soaking it in water , allowing it to begin germination , and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln . malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars . different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain . darker malts will produce darker beers .
usb mice and keyboards can usually be used with older computers that have ps/2 connectors with the aid of a small usb-to-ps/2 adapter . for mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support , an adaptor that contains no logic circuitry may be used : the hardware in the usb keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a usb or ps/2 port , and communicate using the appropriate protocol . converters also exist that connect ps/2 keyboards and mice ( usually one of each ) to a usb port . these devices present two hid endpoints to the system and use a microcontroller to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards .
census-wise , the state is placed 21st on the population chart , followed by tripura at 22nd place . kangra district was top ranked with a population strength of 1,507,223 ( 21.98 % ) , mandi district 999,518 ( 14.58 % ) , shimla district 813,384 ( 11.86 % ) , solan district 576,670 ( 8.41 % ) , sirmaur district 530,164 ( 7.73 % ) , una district 521,057 ( 7.60 % ) , chamba district 518,844 ( 7.57 % ) , hamirpur district 454,293 ( 6.63 % ) , kullu district 437,474 ( 6.38 % ) , bilaspur district 382,056 ( 5.57 % ) , kinnaur district 84,298 ( 1.23 % ) and lahaul spiti 31,528 ( 0.46 % ) .
since whitehead 's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience , he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living , self-conscious beings . the term he coined was " prehension " , which comes from the latin prehensio , meaning " to seize . " the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons . it is also intended to make clear whitehead 's rejection of the theory of representative perception , in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities . for whitehead , the term " prehension " indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself . in this way , entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations , rather than being independent of them . further , whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes , causal efficacy ( or " physical prehension " ) and presentational immediacy ( or " conceptual prehension " ) .
most venezuelans have some indigenous heritage , but the indigenous population make up only around 2 % of the total population . they speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects , but some of the ethnic groups are very small and their languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades . the most important indigenous groups are the ye'kuana , the wayuu , the pemon and the warao . the most advanced native people to have lived in present-day venezuela is thought to have been the timoto-cuicas , who mainly lived in the venezuelan andes . in total it is estimated that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand inhabitants , the most densely populated area being the andean region ( timoto-cuicas ) , thanks to the advanced agricultural techniques used .
in the 1960s , downtown houston consisted of a collection of mid-rise office structures . downtown was on the threshold of an energy industry–led boom in 1970 . a succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s—many by real estate developer gerald d. hines—culminating with houston 's tallest skyscraper , the 75-floor , 1,002-foot ( 305 m ) -tall jpmorgan chase tower ( formerly the texas commerce tower ) , completed in 1982 . it is the tallest structure in texas , 15th tallest building in the united states , and the 85th tallest skyscraper in the world , based on highest architectural feature . in 1983 , the 71-floor , 992-foot ( 302 m ) -tall wells fargo plaza ( formerly allied bank plaza ) was completed , becoming the second-tallest building in houston and texas . based on highest architectural feature , it is the 17th tallest in the united states and the 95th tallest in the world . in 2007 , downtown houston had over 43 million square feet ( 4,000,000 m² ) of office space .
during this period , the island enjoyed increased revenues through the sale of flax , with prices peaking in 1951 . however , the industry declined because of transportation costs and competition from synthetic fibres . the decision by the british post office to use synthetic fibres for its mailbags was a further blow , contributing to the closure of the island 's flax mills in 1965 .
after being rendered obsolete by the redesign , the 1895 replica was presented in 1910 to the fa 's long-serving president lord kinnaird . kinnaird died in 1923 , and his family kept it in their possession , out of view , until putting it up for auction in 2005 . it was duly sold at christie 's auction house on 19 may 2005 for £420,000 ( £478,400 including auction fees and taxes ) . the sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia , surpassing the £254,000 paid for the jules rimet world cup trophy in 1997 . the successful bidder was david gold , the then joint chairman of birmingham city ; claiming the fa and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country , gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation . accordingly , gold presented the trophy to the national football museum in preston on 20 april 2006 , where it went on immediate public display . it later moved with the museum to its new location in manchester . in november 2012 , it was ceremonially presented to royal engineers , after they beat wanderers 7–1 in a charity replay of the first fa cup final .
the light from leds can be modulated very quickly so they are used extensively in optical fiber and free space optics communications . this includes remote controls , such as for tvs , vcrs , and led computers , where infrared leds are often used . opto-isolators use an led combined with a photodiode or phototransistor to provide a signal path with electrical isolation between two circuits . this is especially useful in medical equipment where the signals from a low-voltage sensor circuit ( usually battery-powered ) in contact with a living organism must be electrically isolated from any possible electrical failure in a recording or monitoring device operating at potentially dangerous voltages . an optoisolator also allows information to be transferred between circuits not sharing a common ground potential .
between the 16th century and 19th century , the traditional armenian homeland composed of eastern armenia and western armenia came under the rule of the ottoman and successive iranian empires , repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries . by the 19th century , eastern armenia had been conquered by the russian empire , while most of the western parts of the traditional armenian homeland remained under ottoman rule . during world war i , armenians living in their ancestral lands in the ottoman empire were systematically exterminated in the armenian genocide . in 1918 , after the russian revolution , all non-russian countries declared their independence from the russian empire , leading to the establishment of the first republic of armenia . by 1920 , the state was incorporated into the transcaucasian socialist federative soviet republic , and in 1922 became a founding member of the soviet union . in 1936 , the transcaucasian state was dissolved , transforming its constituent states , including the armenian soviet socialist republic , into full union republics . the modern republic of armenia became independent in 1991 during the dissolution of the soviet union .
britain now threatened to withdraw its subsidies if prussia did n't consider offering concessions to secure peace . as the prussian armies had dwindled to just 60,000 men and with berlin itself under siege , frederick 's survival was severely threatened . then on 5 january 1762 the russian empress elizabeth died . her prussophile successor , peter iii , at once recalled russian armies from berlin ( see : the treaty of saint petersburg ( 1762 ) ) and mediated frederick 's truce with sweden . he also placed a corps of his own troops under frederick 's command this turn of events has become known as the miracle of the house of brandenburg . frederick was then able to muster a larger army of 120,000 men and concentrate it against austria . he drove them from much of saxony , while his brother henry won a victory in silesia in the battle of freiberg ( 29 october 1762 ) . at the same time , his brunswick allies captured the key town of göttingen and compounded this by taking cassel .
the trophy comes in three parts - the cup itself , plus a lid and a base . there have been two designs of trophy in use , but five physical trophies have been presented . the original trophy , known as the " little tin idol " , was 18 inches high and made by martin , hall & co . it was stolen in 1895 and never recovered , and so was replaced by an exact replica , used until 1910 . the fa decided to change the design after the 1909 winners , manchester united , made their own replica , leading the fa to realise they did not own the copyright . this new , larger design was by messers fattorini and sons , and was used from 1911 . in order to preserve this original , from 1992 it was replaced by an exact replica , although this had to be replaced after just over two decades , after showing wear and tear from being handled more than in previous eras . this third replica , first used in 2014 , was built heavier to withstand the increased handling . of the four surviving trophies , only the 1895 replica has entered private ownership .
during the rule of the succeeding hanoverian dynasty , power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government . the first hanoverian monarch , george i , relied on his ministers to a greater extent than did previous monarchs . later hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation : george iii and george iv both openly opposed catholic emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a catholic emancipation bill would violate the coronation oath , which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established church of england from papal domination and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy . however , george iv reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers . thus , as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved , the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse , both in the united kingdom and in the other commonwealth realms .
during the cretaceous , the late paleozoic-early mesozoic supercontinent of pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents , although their positions were substantially different at the time . as the atlantic ocean widened , the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the jurassic continued in the north american cordillera , as the nevadan orogeny was followed by the sevier and laramide orogenies . though gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the cretaceous , gondwana itself broke up as south america , antarctica and australia rifted away from africa ( though india and madagascar remained attached to each other ) ; thus , the south atlantic and indian oceans were newly formed . such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts , raising eustatic sea levels worldwide .
when it comes to civil and criminal cases , the bundesgerichtshof is at the top of the hierarchy of courts . the other branches of the german judicial system each have their own appellate systems , each topped by a high court ; these are the bundessozialgericht for matters of social security , the bundesarbeitsgericht for employment and labour , the bundesfinanzhof for taxation and financial issues , and the bundesverwaltungsgericht for administrative law . the so-called gemeinsamer senat der obersten gerichtshöfe ( joint senate of the supreme courts ) is not a supreme court in itself , but an ad-hoc body that is convened in only when one supreme court intends to diverge from another supreme court 's legal opinion or when a certain case exceeds the authority of one court . as the courts have well-defined areas of responsibility , situations like these are rather rare and so , the joint senate gathers very infrequently , and only to consider matters which are mostly definitory .
the houston theater district , located downtown , is home to nine major performing arts organizations and six performance halls . it is the second-largest concentration of theater seats in a downtown area in the united states . houston is one of few united states cities with permanent , professional , resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines : opera ( houston grand opera ) , ballet ( houston ballet ) , music ( houston symphony orchestra ) , and theater ( the alley theatre ) . houston is also home to folk artists , art groups and various small progressive arts organizations . houston attracts many touring broadway acts , concerts , shows , and exhibitions for a variety of interests . facilities in the theater district include the jones hall—home of the houston symphony orchestra and society for the performing arts—and the hobby center for the performing arts .
defensive counterair ( dca ) is defined as " all the defensive measures designed to detect , identify , intercept , and destroy or negate enemy forces attempting to penetrate or attack through friendly airspace " ( jp 1-02 ) . a major goal of dca operations , in concert with oca operations , is to provide an area from which forces can operate , secure from air and missile threats . the dca mission comprises both active and passive defense measures . active defense is " the employment of limited offensive action and counterattacks to deny a contested area or position to the enemy " ( jp 1-02 ) . it includes both ballistic missile defense and air breathing threat defense , and encompasses point defense , area defense , and high value airborne asset defense . passive defense is " measures taken to reduce the probability of and to minimize the effects of damage caused by hostile action without the intention of taking the initiative " ( jp 1-02 ) . it includes detection and warning ; chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear defense ; camouflage , concealment , and deception ; hardening ; reconstitution ; dispersion ; redundancy ; and mobility , counter-measures , and stealth .
located in jacksonville , marine corps base camp lejeune , combined with nearby bases marine corps air station ( mcas ) cherry point , mcas new river , camp geiger , camp johnson , stone bay and courthouse bay , makes up the largest concentration of marines and sailors in the world . mcas cherry point is home of the 2nd marine aircraft wing . located in goldsboro , seymour johnson air force base is home of the 4th fighter wing and 916th air refueling wing . one of the busiest air stations in the united states coast guard is located at the coast guard air station in elizabeth city . also stationed in north carolina is the military ocean terminal sunny point in southport .
carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of armenian women , including many armenian families . prominent karabakh carpet weavers there were men too . the oldest extant armenian carpet from the region , referred to as artsakh ( see also karabakh carpet ) during the medieval era , is from the village of banants ( near gandzak ) and dates to the early 13th century . the first time that the armenian word for carpet , gorg , was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 armenian inscription on the wall of the kaptavan church in artsakh .
ship transport is an important component of melbourne 's transport system . the port of melbourne is australia 's largest container and general cargo port and also its busiest . the port handled two million shipping containers in a 12-month period during 2007 , making it one of the top five ports in the southern hemisphere . station pier on port phillip bay is the main passenger ship terminal with cruise ships and the spirit of tasmania ferries which cross bass strait to tasmania docking there . ferries and water taxis run from berths along the yarra river as far upstream as south yarra and across port phillip bay .
compaq , who had previously held the third place spot among pc manufacturers during the 1980s and early-mid 1990s , initiated a successful price war in 1994 that vaulted them to the biggest by the year end , overtaking a struggling ibm and relegating apple to third place . apple 's market share further struggled due to the release of the windows 95 operating system , which unified microsoft 's formerly separate ms-dos and windows products . windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of ibm pc compatible computers , and brought the capabilities of windows to parity with the mac os gui .
in 1887 , the british empire celebrated victoria 's golden jubilee . victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 june with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited . the following day , she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in westminster abbey . by this time , victoria was once again extremely popular . two days later on 23 june , she engaged two indian muslims as waiters , one of whom was abdul karim . he was soon promoted to " munshi " : teaching her hindustani , and acting as a clerk . her family and retainers were appalled , and accused abdul karim of spying for the muslim patriotic league , and biasing the queen against the hindus . equerry frederick ponsonby ( the son of sir henry ) discovered that the munshi had lied about his parentage , and reported to lord elgin , viceroy of india , " the munshi occupies very much the same position as john brown used to do . " victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice . abdul karim remained in her service until he returned to india with a pension on her death .

on november 18 , 1990 , the ukrainian autocephalous orthodox church enthroned mstyslav as patriarch of kiev and all ukraine during ceremonies at saint sophia 's cathedral . also on november 18 , canada announced that its consul-general to kiev would be ukrainian-canadian nestor gayowsky . on november 19 , the united states announced that its consul to kiev would be ukrainian-american john stepanchuk . on november 19 , the chairmen of the ukrainian and russian parliaments , respectively , kravchuk and yeltsin , signed a 10-year bilateral pact . in early december 1990 the party of democratic rebirth of ukraine was founded ; on december 15 , the democratic party of ukraine was founded .
serious financial damage has been caused by security breaches , but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident , the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved . " several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general . the 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $ 13 billion ( worms and viruses only ) to $ 226 billion ( for all forms of covert attacks ) . the reliability of these estimates is often challenged ; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal . "
since the industrial revolution some two hundred years ago , the food processing industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature . cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness , whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled . these latter technologies include pasteurisation , autoclavation , drying , salting , and separation of various components , all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food . pasteurisation and autoclavation ( heating techniques ) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods , preventing epidemics of bacterial infection . but some of the ( new ) food processing technologies have downfalls as well .
sensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived . the ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation , or memorization , is the example of sensory memory . it is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response . with very short presentations , participants often report that they seem to " see " more than they can actually report . the first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by george sperling ( 1963 ) using the " partial report paradigm " . subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters , arranged into three rows of four . after a brief presentation , subjects were then played either a high , medium or low tone , cuing them which of the rows to report . based on these partial report experiments , sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items , but that it degraded very quickly ( within a few hundred milliseconds ) . because this form of memory degrades so quickly , participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items ( 12 in the " whole report " procedure ) before they decayed . this type of memory can not be prolonged via rehearsal .
their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made these mediterranean universities similar to islamic madrasas , although madrasas were generally smaller and individual teachers , rather than the madrasa itself , granted the license or degree . scholars like arnold h. green and hossein nasr have argued that starting in the 10th century , some medieval islamic madrasahs became universities . george makdisi and others , however , argue that the european university has no parallel in the medieval islamic world . other scholars regard the university as uniquely european in origin and characteristics .
his best known wife was jovanka broz . tito was just shy of his 59th birthday , while she was 27 , when they finally married in april 1952 , with state security chief aleksandar ranković as the best man . their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante ivan krajacic brought her in originally . at that time , she was in her early 20s and tito , objecting to her energetic personality , opted for the more mature opera singer zinka kunc instead . not one to be discouraged easily , jovanka continued working at beli dvor , where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance after tito 's strange relationship with zinka failed . since jovanka was the only female companion he married while in power , she also went down in history as yugoslavia 's first lady . their relationship was not a happy one , however . it had gone through many , often public , ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a coup d'état by the latter pair . certain unofficial reports suggest tito and jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s , shortly before his death . however , during tito 's funeral she was officially present as his wife , and later claimed rights for inheritance . the couple did not have any children .
areas that should not be soldered may be covered with solder resist ( solder mask ) . one of the most common solder resists used today is called " lpi " ( liquid photoimageable solder mask ) . a photo-sensitive coating is applied to the surface of the pwb , then exposed to light through the solder mask image film , and finally developed where the unexposed areas are washed away . dry film solder mask is similar to the dry film used to image the pwb for plating or etching . after being laminated to the pwb surface it is imaged and develop as lpi . once common but no longer commonly used because of its low accuracy and resolution is to screen print epoxy ink . solder resist also provides protection from the environment .
according to the rev . john gulick : " the inhabitants of other asiatic nations , who have had occasion to represent the words of their several languages by chinese characters , have as a rule used unaspirated characters for the sounds , g , d , b . the muslims from arabia and persia have followed this method … the mongols , manchu , and japanese also constantly select unaspirated characters to represent the sounds g , d , b , and j of their languages . these surrounding asiatic nations , in writing chinese words in their own alphabets , have uniformly used g , d , b , & c. , to represent the unaspirated sounds . "
law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . in some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . the police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
after a death sentence is affirmed in state collateral review , the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus , which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts . federal habeas corpus is a species of collateral review , and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court ( other than petitions for certiorari to the united states supreme court after both direct review and state collateral review ) . the scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 , which restricted significantly its previous scope . the purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts , through the process of direct review and state collateral review , have done at least a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner 's federal constitutional rights . prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime , though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process , evidence of innocence must be truly compelling .
in july 2015 , eton accidentally sent emails to 400 prospective students , offering them conditional entrance to the school in september 2017 . the email was intended for nine students , but an it glitch caused the email to be sent to 400 additional families , who did n't necessarily have a place . in response , the school issued the following statement : " this error was discovered within minutes and each family was immediately contacted to notify them that it should be disregarded and to apologise . we take this type of incident very seriously indeed and so a thorough investigation , overseen by the headmaster tony little and led by the tutor for admissions , is being carried out to find out exactly what went wrong and ensure it can not happen again . eton college offers its sincere apologies to those boys concerned and their families . we deeply regret the confusion and upset this must have caused .

compact disc ( cd ) is a digital optical disc data storage format . the format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data ( cd-rom ) . several other formats were further derived from these , including write-once audio and data storage ( cd-r ) , rewritable media ( cd-rw ) , video compact disc ( vcd ) , super video compact disc ( svcd ) , photo cd , picturecd , cd-i , and enhanced music cd . audio cds and audio cd players have been commercially available since october 1982 .
the climate of the coastal plain is influenced by the atlantic ocean , which keeps conditions mild in winter and moderate , although humid , in summer . the highest coastal , daytime temperature averages less than 89 °f ( 32 °c ) during summer months . the coast has mild temperatures in winter , with daytime highs rarely below 40 °f ( 4 °c ) . the average daytime temperature in the coastal plain is usually in the mid-50s °f ( 11–14 °c ) in winter . temperatures in the coastal plain only occasionally drop below the freezing point at night . the coastal plain averages only around 1 inch ( 2.5 cm ) of snow or ice annually , and in many years , there may be no snow or ice at all .
insect respiration is accomplished without lungs . instead , the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped , delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea ( element 8 in numbered diagram ) . since oxygen is delivered directly , the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen , and is therefore greatly reduced . the insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries , and instead consists of little more than a single , perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically . toward the thorax , the dorsal tube ( element 14 ) divides into chambers and acts like the insect 's heart . the opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph , arthropods ' fluid analog of blood , inside the body cavity . :61–65 air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles .
french-speaking naturalists in several countries showed appreciation of the much modified french translation by clémence royer , but darwin 's ideas had little impact in france , where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of lamarckism . the intelligentsia in russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before darwin had published his theory , and scientists were quick to take it into account , although the malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant . the political economy of struggle was criticised as a british stereotype by karl marx and by leo tolstoy , who had the character levin in his novel anna karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of darwin 's views .
somalis ( somali : soomaali , arabic : صومال‎ ) are an ethnic group inhabiting the horn of africa ( somali peninsula ) . the overwhelming majority of somalis speak the somali language , which is part of the cushitic branch of the afro-asiatic family . they are predominantly sunni muslim . ethnic somalis number around 16-20 million and are principally concentrated in somalia ( around 12.3 million ) , ethiopia ( 4.6 million ) , kenya ( 2.4 million ) , and djibouti ( 464,600 ) , with many also residing in parts of the middle east , north america and europe .
according to the prevailing theories of the settlement of the americas , migrations of humans from asia ( in particular north asia ) to the americas took place via beringia , a land bridge which connected the two continents across what is now the bering strait . the majority of experts agree that the earliest pre-modern human migration via beringia took place at least 13,500 years ago , with disputed evidence that people had migrated into the americas much earlier , up to 40,000 years ago . these early paleo-indians spread throughout the americas , diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes . according to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the americas , they have been living there since their genesis , described by a wide range of creation myths .
historical narratives of manga tend to focus either on its recent , post-wwii history , or on attempts to demonstrates deep roots in the past , such as to the chōjū-jinbutsu-giga picture scroll of the 12th and 13th centuries , or the early 19th-century hokusai manga . the first historical overview of japanese comics was seiki hosokibara 's nihon manga-shi [ i ] in 1924 . early post-war japanese criticism was mostly of a left-wing political nature until the 1986 publication for tomofusa kure 's modern manga : the complete picture , [ j ] which de-emphasized politics in favour of formal aspects , such as structure and a " grammar " of comics . the field of manga studies increased rapidly , with numerous books on the subject appearing in the 1990s . formal theories of manga have focused on developing a " manga expression theory " , [ k ] with emphasis on spatial relationships in the structure of images on the page , distinguishing the medium from film or literature , in which the flow of time is the basic organizing element . comics studies courses have proliferated at japanese universities , and japan society for studies in cartoon and comics ( ja ) [ l ] was established in 2001 to promote comics scholarship . the publication of frederik l. schodt 's manga ! manga ! the world of japanese comics in 1983 led to the spread of use of the word manga outside japan to mean " japanese comics " or " japanese-style comics " .

switzerland has a dense network of cities , where large , medium and small cities are complementary . the plateau is very densely populated with about 450 people per km2 and the landscape continually shows signs of human presence . the weight of the largest metropolitan areas , which are zürich , geneva–lausanne , basel and bern tend to increase . in international comparison the importance of these urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests . in addition the two main centers of zürich and geneva are recognized for their particularly great quality of life .
sociologist james a. beckford , in his 1975 study of jehovah 's witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of god 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that jehovah 's witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .

under the capetian dynasty france slowly began to expand its authority over the nobility , growing out of the île-de-france to exert control over more of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries . they faced a powerful rival in the dukes of normandy , who in 1066 under william the conqueror ( duke 1035–1087 ) , conquered england ( r. 1066–87 ) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted , in various forms , throughout the rest of the middle ages . normans also settled in sicily and southern italy , when robert guiscard ( d. 1085 ) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the kingdom of sicily . under the angevin dynasty of henry ii ( r. 1154–89 ) and his son richard i ( r. 1189–99 ) , the kings of england ruled over england and large areas of france , [ w ] brought to the family by henry ii 's marriage to eleanor of aquitaine ( d. 1204 ) , heiress to much of southern france . [ x ] richard 's younger brother john ( r. 1199–1216 ) lost normandy and the rest of the northern french possessions in 1204 to the french king philip ii augustus ( r. 1180–1223 ) . this led to dissension among the english nobility , while john 's financial exactions to pay for his unsuccessful attempts to regain normandy led in 1215 to magna carta , a charter that confirmed the rights and privileges of free men in england . under henry iii ( r. 1216–72 ) , john 's son , further concessions were made to the nobility , and royal power was diminished . the french monarchy continued to make gains against the nobility during the late 12th and 13th centuries , bringing more territories within the kingdom under their personal rule and centralising the royal administration . under louis ix ( r. 1226–70 ) , royal prestige rose to new heights as louis served as a mediator for most of europe .

proponents of affirmative action argue that by nature the system is not only race based , but also class and gender based . to eliminate two of its key components would undermine the purpose of the entire system . the african american policy forum believes that the class based argument is based on the idea that non-poor minorities do not experience racial and gender based discrimination . the aapf believes that " race-conscious affirmative action remains necessary to address race-based obstacles that block the path to success of countless people of color of all classes " . the groups goes on to say that affirmative action is responsible for creating the african american middle class , so it does not make sense to say that the system only benefits the middle and upper classes .

uruguay 's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between manuel oribe and fructuoso rivera , the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the empire of brazil under the command of lavalleja , each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction . politics were divided between oribe 's blancos ( " whites " ) , represented by the national party , and rivera 's colorados ( " reds " ) , represented by the colorado party , with each party 's name taken from the colour of its emblems . in 1838 , oribe was forced to resign the presidency ; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war , the guerra grande , which lasted until 1851 .
some evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals . for example , sweden has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops . [ unreliable source ? ] in indonesia , farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65 % and experienced a 15 % crop increase . [ unreliable source ? ] a study of maize fields in northern florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high carbon to nitrogen ratio to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic nematodes and increasing crop yield , with yield increases ranging from 10 % to 212 % ; the observed effects were long-term , often not appearing until the third season of the study .
in 2008 , india suspended military aid to myanmar over the issue of human rights abuses by the ruling junta , although it has preserved extensive commercial ties , which provide the regime with much-needed revenue . the thaw in relations began on 28 november 2011 , when belarusian prime minister mikhail myasnikovich and his wife ludmila arrived in the capital , naypyidaw , the same day as the country received a visit by us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton , who also met with pro-democracy opposition leader aung san suu kyi . international relations progress indicators continued in september 2012 when aung san suu kyi visited to the us followed by myanmar 's reformist president visit to the united nations .
catalan shares many traits with its neighboring romance languages . however , despite being mostly situated in the iberian peninsula , catalan differs more from iberian romance ( such as spanish and portuguese ) in terms of vocabulary , pronunciation , and grammar than from gallo-romance ( occitan , french , gallo-italic languages , etc. ) . these similarities are most notable with occitan .
glaciers pick up rocks and sediment with them as they flow . this causes erosion and the formation of valleys over time . the inn valley is an example of a valley carved by glaciers during the ice ages with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion . eroded rocks from the most recent ice age lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of erosion from earlier ice ages . glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls ( reliefs ) ; valleys with lower reliefs and talus slopes are remnants of glacial troughs or previously infilled valleys . moraines , piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier , accumulate at edges , center and the terminus of glaciers .
after the english civil war the royal citadel was built in 1666 on the east end of plymouth hoe , to defend the port from naval attacks , suppress plymothian parliamentary leanings and to train the armed forces . guided tours are available in the summer months . further west is smeaton 's tower , which was built in 1759 as a lighthouse on rocks 14 miles ( 23 km ) off shore , but dismantled and the top two thirds rebuilt on the hoe in 1877 . it is open to the public and has views over the plymouth sound and the city from the lantern room . plymouth has 20 war memorials of which nine are on the hoe including : plymouth naval memorial , to remember those killed in world wars i and ii , and the armada memorial , to commemorate the defeat of the spanish armada .
there is an environmental program , called hoy no circula ( " today does not run " , or " one day without a car " ) , whereby vehicles that have not passed emissions testing are restricted from circulating on certain days according to the ending digit of their license plates ; this in an attempt to cut down on pollution and traffic congestion . while in 2003 , the program still restricted 40 % of vehicles in the metropolitan area , with the adoption of stricter emissions standards in 2001 and 2006 , in practice , these days most vehicles are exempt from the circulation restrictions as long as they pass regular emissions tests .
the western section of the state is part of the appalachian mountain range . among the subranges of the appalachians located in the state are the great smoky mountains , blue ridge mountains , great balsam mountains , and black mountains . the black mountains are the highest in the eastern united states , and culminate in mount mitchell at 6,684 feet ( 2,037 m ) the highest point east of the mississippi river . although agriculture still remains important , tourism has become a dominant industry in the mountains . growing christmas trees has recently become an important industry as well . because of the higher altitude , the climate in the mountains often differs markedly from that of the rest of the state . winter in western north carolina typically features high snowfall and subfreezing temperatures more akin to those of a midwestern state than of a southern state .
public institutions of higher education in charleston include the college of charleston ( the nation 's 13th-oldest university ) , the citadel , the military college of south carolina , and the medical university of south carolina . the city is also home to private universities , including the charleston school of law . charleston is also home to the roper hospital school of practical nursing , and the city has a downtown satellite campus for the region 's technical school , trident technical college . charleston is also the location for the only college in the country that offers bachelor 's degrees in the building arts , the american college of the building arts . the art institute of charleston , located downtown on north market street , opened in 2007 .
in styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . the most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the french invader . he has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled rubik 's cubes . although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in mosaic styles as well .
marine mammals are many , such as the dolphins , porpoises and whales , which are seen here during the migration period from december till may . turtles are a common sight along the coastline of the island . they are a protected species and in the endangered list . it is stated that it will take 15–50 years for this species to attain reproductive age . though they live in the sea , the females come to the shore to lay eggs and are protected by private societies . three species of turtles are particularly notable . these are : the leatherback sea turtles which have leather skin instead of a shell and are the largest of the type found here , some times measuring a much as 3 m ( average is about 1.5 m ) and weighing about 450 kg ( jellyfish is their favourite diet ) ; the hawksbill turtles , which have hawk-like beaks and found near reefs , generally about 90 cm in diameter and weigh about 60 kg and their diet consists of crabs and snails ; and the green turtles , herbivores which have rounded heads , generally about 90 cm in diameter and live amidst tall sea grasses .
the ottoman empire or , as a dynastic institution , the house of osman was unprecedented and unequaled in the islamic world for its size and duration . in europe , only the house of habsburg had a similarly unbroken line of sovereigns ( kings/emperors ) from the same family who ruled for so long , and during the same period , between the late 13th and early 20th centuries . the ottoman dynasty was turkish in origin . on eleven occasions , the sultan was deposed ( replaced by another sultan of the ottoman dynasty , who were either the former sultan 's brother , son or nephew ) because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state . there were only two attempts in ottoman history to unseat the ruling ottoman dynasty , both failures , which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability . as such , the last ottoman sultan mehmed vi ( r. 1918–1922 ) was a direct patrilineal ( male-line ) descendant of the first ottoman sultan osman i ( r. 1299–1326 ) , which was unparallelled in both europe ( e.g . the male line of the house of habsburg became extinct in 1740 ) and in the islamic world . the primary purpose of the imperial harem was to ensure the birth of male heirs to the ottoman throne and secure the continuation of the direct patrilineal ( male-line ) descendance of the ottoman sultans .
philadelphia artists have had a prominent national role in popular music . in the 1970s , philadelphia soul influenced the music of that and later eras . on july 13 , 1985 , philadelphia hosted the american end of the live aid concert at john f. kennedy stadium . the city reprised this role for the live 8 concert , bringing some 700,000 people to the ben franklin parkway on july 2 , 2005 . philadelphia is home to the world-renowned philadelphia boys choir & chorale , which has performed its music all over the world . dr. robert g. hamilton , founder of the choir , is a notable native philadelphian . the philly pops is another famous philadelphia music group . the city has played a major role in the development and support of american rock music and rap music . hip-hop/rap artists such as the roots , dj jazzy jeff & the fresh prince , the goats , freeway , schoolly d , eve , and lisa " left eye " lopes hail from the city .
after christianization , the roman catholic church and local rulers led german expansion and settlement in areas inhabited by slavs and balts , known as ostsiedlung . during the wars waged in the baltic by the catholic german teutonic knights ; the lands inhabited by the ethnic group of the old prussians ( the current reference to the people known then simply as the " prussians " ) , were conquered by the germans . the old prussians were an ethnic group related to the latvian and lithuanian baltic peoples . the former german state of prussia took its name from the baltic prussians , although it was led by germans who had assimilated the old prussians ; the old prussian language was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century . the slavic people of the teutonic-controlled baltic were assimilated into german culture and eventually there were many intermarriages of slavic and german families , including amongst the prussia 's aristocracy known as the junkers . prussian military strategist karl von clausewitz is a famous german whose surname is of slavic origin . massive german settlement led to the assimilation of baltic ( old prussians ) and slavic ( wends ) populations , who were exhausted by previous warfare .
several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics . the issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the us interagency task force on antimicrobial resistance . this task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance , and is coordinated by the us centers for disease control and prevention , the food and drug administration ( fda ) , and the national institutes of health ( nih ) , as well as other us agencies . an ngo campaign group is keep antibiotics working . in france , an " antibiotics are not automatic " government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions , especially in children .
political boundaries drawn by the british did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions , contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas . the british empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples . millions left the british isles , with the founding settler populations of the united states , canada , australia and new zealand coming mainly from britain and ireland . tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities , and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in south africa and zimbabwe . settlers in ireland from great britain have left their mark in the form of divided nationalist and unionist communities in northern ireland . millions of people moved to and from british colonies , with large numbers of indians emigrating to other parts of the empire , such as malaysia and fiji , and chinese people to malaysia , singapore and the caribbean . the demographics of britain itself was changed after the second world war owing to immigration to britain from its former colonies .
sanskrit ( /ˈsænskrɪt/ ; sanskrit : saṃskṛtam [ səmskr̩t̪əm ] or saṃskṛta , originally saṃskṛtā vāk , " refined speech " ) is the primary sacred language of hinduism , a philosophical language in buddhism , hinduism , sikhism and jainism , and a literary language that was in use as a lingua franca in greater india . it is a standardised dialect of old indo-aryan , originating as vedic sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to proto-indo-iranian and proto-indo-european . today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of india and is an official language of the state of uttarakhand . as one of the oldest indo-european languages for which substantial written documentation exists , sanskrit holds a prominent position in indo-european studies .

the initial near-complete mpeg-1 standard ( parts 1 , 2 and 3 ) was publicly available on 6 december 1991 as iso cd 11172 . in most countries , patents can not be filed after prior art has been made public , and patents expire 20 years after the initial filing date , which can be up to 12 months later for filings in other countries . as a result , patents required to implement mp3 expired in most countries by december 2012 , 21 years after the publication of iso cd 11172 .
the elimination of wolves from yellowstone national park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid . without predation , herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species , affecting the area 's plant populations . in addition , wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas , which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon . the removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations , as their habitat became territory for grazing . furthermore , predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order . increased browsing on willows and conifers along blacktail creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place .
after being lit at the birthplace of the olympic games in olympia , greece on march 24 , the torch traveled to the panathinaiko stadium in athens , and then to beijing , arriving on march 31 . from beijing , the torch was following a route passing through six continents . the torch has visited cities along the silk road , symbolizing ancient links between china and the rest of the world . the relay also included an ascent with the flame to the top of mount everest on the border of nepal and tibet , china from the chinese side , which was closed specially for the event .
throughout history there have been a series of lingua francas in the area to allow for better communication . the dialects spoken in hangzhou , shaoxing , and ningbo have taken on this role historically . since the founding of the people 's republic of china in 1949 , mandarin , which is not mutually intelligible with any of the local dialects , has been promoted as the standard language of communication throughout china . as a result , most of the population now can , to some degree , speak and comprehend mandarin and can code-switch when necessary . a majority of the population educated since 1978 can speak mandarin . urban residents tend to be more fluent in mandarin than rural people . nevertheless , a zhejiang accent is detectable in almost everyone from the area communicating in mandarin , and the home dialect remains an important part of the everyday lives and cultural identities of most zhejiang residents .
adolescence ( from latin adolescere , meaning " to grow up " ) is a transitional stage of physical and psychological human development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood ( age of majority ) . the period of adolescence is most closely associated with the teenage years , though its physical , psychological and cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later . for example , although puberty has been historically associated with the onset of adolescent development , it now typically begins prior to the teenage years and there has been a normative shift of it occurring in preadolescence , particularly in females ( see precocious puberty ) . physical growth , as distinct from puberty ( particularly in males ) , and cognitive development generally seen in adolescence , can also extend into the early twenties . thus chronological age provides only a rough marker of adolescence , and scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise definition of adolescence .
humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions to environmental hazards . examples include : space suits , air conditioned clothing , armor , diving suits , swimsuits , bee-keeper gear , motorcycle leathers , high-visibility clothing , and other pieces of protective clothing . meanwhile , the distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut—since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design . wearing clothes also has social implications . they cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered , act as a form of adornment , and serve other social purposes .
although anthropologists worldwide refer to tylor 's definition of culture , in the 20th century " culture " emerged as the central and unifying concept of american anthropology , where it most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human experiences symbolically , and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially . [ citation needed ] american anthropology is organized into four fields , each of which plays an important role in research on culture : biological anthropology , linguistic anthropology , cultural anthropology , and archaeology .
chickens raised intensively for their meat are known as " broilers " . breeds have been developed that can grow to an acceptable carcass size ( 2 kg ( 4.4 lb ) ) in six weeks or less . broilers grow so fast , their legs can not always support their weight and their hearts and respiratory systems may not be able to supply enough oxygen to their developing muscles . mortality rates at 1 % are much higher than for less-intensively reared laying birds which take 18 weeks to reach similar weights . processing the birds is done automatically with conveyor-belt efficiency . they are hung by their feet , stunned , killed , bled , scalded , plucked , have their heads and feet removed , eviscerated , washed , chilled , drained , weighed , and packed , all within the course of little over two hours .
hydrogen production technologies been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s . aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells , several thermochemical processes have also been explored . one such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures ( 2,300–2,600 °c or 4,200–4,700 °f ) . another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods . thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production . the solzinc process under development at the weizmann institute uses a 1 mw solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide ( zno ) at temperatures above 1,200 °c ( 2,200 °f ) . this initial reaction produces pure zinc , which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen .
although the palaeologi emperors recaptured constantinople from the western europeans in 1261 , they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands . they usually controlled only a small section of the balkan peninsula near constantinople , the city itself , and some coastal lands on the black sea and around the aegean sea . the former byzantine lands in the balkans were divided between the new kingdom of serbia , the second bulgarian empire and the city-state of venice . the power of the byzantine emperors was threatened by a new turkish tribe , the ottomans , who established themselves in anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century . the ottomans expanded into europe , reducing bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over serbia after its defeat at the battle of kosovo in 1389 . western europeans rallied to the plight of the christians in the balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396 ; a great army was sent to the balkans , where it was defeated at the battle of nicopolis . constantinople was finally captured by the ottomans in 1453 .
glass-ceramic materials share many properties with both non-crystalline glass and crystalline ceramics . they are formed as a glass , and then partially crystallized by heat treatment . for example , the microstructure of whiteware ceramics frequently contains both amorphous and crystalline phases . crystalline grains are often embedded within a non-crystalline intergranular phase of grain boundaries . when applied to whiteware ceramics , vitreous means the material has an extremely low permeability to liquids , often but not always water , when determined by a specified test regime .
in 1983 fighting between palestinian refugees and lebanese factions reignited that nation 's long-running civil war . a un agreement brought an international force of peacekeepers to occupy beirut and guarantee security . us marines landed in august 1982 along with italian and french forces . on october 23 , 1983 , a suicide bomber driving a truck filled with 6 tons of tnt crashed through a fence and destroyed the marine barracks , killing 241 marines ; seconds later , a second bomber leveled a french barracks , killing 58 . subsequently the us navy engaged in bombing of militia positions inside lebanon . while us president ronald reagan was initially defiant , political pressure at home eventually forced the withdrawal of the marines in february 1984 .
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 , a state prisoner is ordinarily only allowed one suit for habeas corpus in federal court . if the federal courts refuse to issue a writ of habeas corpus , an execution date may be set . in recent times , however , prisoners have postponed execution through a final round of federal litigation using the civil rights act of 1871 — codified at 42 u.s.c . § 1983 — which allows people to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights .
the gothic vault , unlike the semi-circular vault of roman and romanesque buildings , can be used to roof rectangular and irregularly shaped plans such as trapezoids . the other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle . this enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in romanesque architecture . while , structurally , use of the pointed arch gave a greater flexibility to architectural form , it also gave gothic architecture a very different and more vertical visual character than romanesque .
upon the invitation of duke konrad i of masovia , the teutonic knights took possession of prussia in the 13th century and created a monastic state to administer the conquered old prussians . local old-prussian ( north ) and polish ( south ) toponyms were gradually germanised . the knights ' expansionist policies , including occupation of polish pomerania with gdańsk/danzig and western lithuania , brought them into conflict with the kingdom of poland and embroiled them in several wars , culminating in the polish-lithuanian-teutonic war , whereby the united armies of poland and lithuania , defeated the teutonic order at the battle of grunwald ( tannenberg ) in 1410 . its defeat was formalised in the second treaty of thorn in 1466 ending the thirteen years ' war , and leaving the former polish region pomerania/pomerelia under polish control . together with warmia it formed the province of royal prussia . eastern prussia remained under the knights , but as a fief of poland . 1466 and 1525 arrangements by kings of poland were not verified by the holy roman empire as well as the previous gains of the teutonic knights were not verified .
a notable pattern that developed during the 2000s and 2010s has been for certain pop songs to have lengthy runs on ac charts , even after the songs have fallen off the hot 100 . adrian moreira , senior vice president for adult music for rca music group , said , " we 've seen a fairly tidal shift in what ac will play " . rather than emphasizing older songs , adult contemporary was playing many of the same songs as top 40 and adult top 40 , but only after the hits had become established . an article on mtv 's website by corey moss describes this trend : " in other words , ac stations are where pop songs go to die a very long death . or , to optimists , to get a second life .

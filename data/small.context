sociologist james a. beckford , in his 1975 study of jehovah 's witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of god 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that jehovah 's witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .
the geologic record of the proterozoic ( 2,500 to 541 million years ago ) is more complete than that for the preceding archean . in contrast to the deep-water deposits of the archean , the proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive shallow epicontinental seas ; furthermore , many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than archean-age ones , and plenty are unaltered . study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive , rapid continental accretion ( unique to the proterozoic ) , supercontinent cycles , and wholly modern orogenic activity . roughly 750 million years ago , the earliest-known supercontinent rodinia , began to break apart . the continents later recombined to form pannotia , 600–540 ma .
ottoman turkish was the official language of the empire . it was an oghuz turkic language highly influenced by persian and arabic . the ottomans had several influential languages : turkish , spoken by the majority of the people in anatolia and by the majority of muslims of the balkans except in albania and bosnia ; persian , only spoken by the educated ; arabic , spoken mainly in arabia , north africa , iraq , kuwait , the levant and parts of the horn of africa ; and somali throughout the horn of africa . in the last two centuries , usage of these became limited , though , and specific : persian served mainly as a literary language for the educated , while arabic was used for religious rites .
madonna 's use of sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism . as roger chapman documents in culture wars : an encyclopedia of issues , viewpoints , and voices , volume 1 ( 2010 ) , she has drawn frequent condemnation from religious organizations , social conservatives and parental watchdog groups for her use of explicit , sexual imagery and lyrics , religious symbolism , and otherwise " irreverent " behavior in her live performances . the times wrote that she had " started a revolution amongst women in music ... her attitudes and opinions on sex , nudity , style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice . " professor john fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self , of sexuality , and of one 's social relations . in doing gender in media , art and culture ( 2009 ) , the authors noted that madonna , as a female celebrity , performer , and pop icon , is able to unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates . according to lesbian feminist sheila jeffreys , madonna represents woman 's occupancy of what monique wittig calls the category of sex , as powerful , and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corvée allotted to women . professor sut jhally has referred to madonna as " an almost sacred feminist icon . "
the group changed their name to destiny 's child in 1996 , based upon a passage in the book of isaiah . in 1997 , destiny 's child released their major label debut song " killing time " on the soundtrack to the 1997 film , men in black . the following year , the group released their self-titled debut album , scoring their first major hit " no , no , no " . the album established the group as a viable act in the music industry , with moderate sales and winning the group three soul train lady of soul awards for best r & b/soul album of the year , best r & b/soul or rap new artist , and best r & b/soul single for " no , no , no " . the group released their multi-platinum second album the writing 's on the wall in 1999 . the record features some of the group 's most widely known songs such as " bills , bills , bills " , the group 's first number-one single , " jumpin ' jumpin ' " and " say my name " , which became their most successful song at the time , and would remain one of their signature songs . " say my name " won the best r & b performance by a duo or group with vocals and the best r & b song at the 43rd annual grammy awards . the writing 's on the wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide . during this time , beyoncé recorded a duet with marc nelson , an original member of boyz ii men , on the song " after all is said and done " for the soundtrack to the 1999 film , the best man .
through the influence of the eusebian faction at constantinople , an arian bishop , george of cappadocia , was now appointed to rule the see of alexandria . athanasius , after remaining some days in the neighbourhood of the city , finally withdrew into the desert of upper egypt , where he remained for a period of six years , living the life of the monks , devoting himself to the composition of a group of writings ; " apology to constantius " , the " apology for his flight " , the " letter to the monks " , and the " history of the arians " .
in march 2008 , it was announced that avicenna 's name would be used for new directories of education institutions for health care professionals , worldwide . the avicenna directories will list universities and schools where doctors , public health practitioners , pharmacists and others , are educated . the project team stated " why avicenna ? avicenna ... was ... noted for his synthesis of knowledge from both east and west . he has had a lasting influence on the development of medicine and health sciences . the use of avicenna 's name symbolises the worldwide partnership that is needed for the promotion of health services of high quality . "
the root system and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food , and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system . cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots . stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots . roots that spread out close to the surface , such as those of willows , can produce shoots and ultimately new plants . in the event that one of the systems is lost , the other can often regrow it . in fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf , as is the case with saintpaulia , or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus ( a mass of unspecialised cells ) that can grow into a new plant . in vascular plants , the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots . roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch , as in sugar beets and carrots .
having produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with , the next stage is to translate this into a schema that implements the relevant data structures within the database . this process is often called logical database design , and the output is a logical data model expressed in the form of a schema . whereas the conceptual data model is ( in theory at least ) independent of the choice of database technology , the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen dbms . ( the terms data model and database model are often used interchangeably , but in this article we use data model for the design of a specific database , and database model for the modelling notation used to express that design . )
the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer . the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain . grain is malted by soaking it in water , allowing it to begin germination , and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln . malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars . different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain . darker malts will produce darker beers .
usb mice and keyboards can usually be used with older computers that have ps/2 connectors with the aid of a small usb-to-ps/2 adapter . for mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support , an adaptor that contains no logic circuitry may be used : the hardware in the usb keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a usb or ps/2 port , and communicate using the appropriate protocol . converters also exist that connect ps/2 keyboards and mice ( usually one of each ) to a usb port . these devices present two hid endpoints to the system and use a microcontroller to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards .
census-wise , the state is placed 21st on the population chart , followed by tripura at 22nd place . kangra district was top ranked with a population strength of 1,507,223 ( 21.98 % ) , mandi district 999,518 ( 14.58 % ) , shimla district 813,384 ( 11.86 % ) , solan district 576,670 ( 8.41 % ) , sirmaur district 530,164 ( 7.73 % ) , una district 521,057 ( 7.60 % ) , chamba district 518,844 ( 7.57 % ) , hamirpur district 454,293 ( 6.63 % ) , kullu district 437,474 ( 6.38 % ) , bilaspur district 382,056 ( 5.57 % ) , kinnaur district 84,298 ( 1.23 % ) and lahaul spiti 31,528 ( 0.46 % ) .
since whitehead 's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience , he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living , self-conscious beings . the term he coined was " prehension " , which comes from the latin prehensio , meaning " to seize . " the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons . it is also intended to make clear whitehead 's rejection of the theory of representative perception , in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities . for whitehead , the term " prehension " indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself . in this way , entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations , rather than being independent of them . further , whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes , causal efficacy ( or " physical prehension " ) and presentational immediacy ( or " conceptual prehension " ) .
most venezuelans have some indigenous heritage , but the indigenous population make up only around 2 % of the total population . they speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects , but some of the ethnic groups are very small and their languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades . the most important indigenous groups are the ye'kuana , the wayuu , the pemon and the warao . the most advanced native people to have lived in present-day venezuela is thought to have been the timoto-cuicas , who mainly lived in the venezuelan andes . in total it is estimated that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand inhabitants , the most densely populated area being the andean region ( timoto-cuicas ) , thanks to the advanced agricultural techniques used .
in the 1960s , downtown houston consisted of a collection of mid-rise office structures . downtown was on the threshold of an energy industry–led boom in 1970 . a succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s—many by real estate developer gerald d. hines—culminating with houston 's tallest skyscraper , the 75-floor , 1,002-foot ( 305 m ) -tall jpmorgan chase tower ( formerly the texas commerce tower ) , completed in 1982 . it is the tallest structure in texas , 15th tallest building in the united states , and the 85th tallest skyscraper in the world , based on highest architectural feature . in 1983 , the 71-floor , 992-foot ( 302 m ) -tall wells fargo plaza ( formerly allied bank plaza ) was completed , becoming the second-tallest building in houston and texas . based on highest architectural feature , it is the 17th tallest in the united states and the 95th tallest in the world . in 2007 , downtown houston had over 43 million square feet ( 4,000,000 m² ) of office space .
during this period , the island enjoyed increased revenues through the sale of flax , with prices peaking in 1951 . however , the industry declined because of transportation costs and competition from synthetic fibres . the decision by the british post office to use synthetic fibres for its mailbags was a further blow , contributing to the closure of the island 's flax mills in 1965 .
after being rendered obsolete by the redesign , the 1895 replica was presented in 1910 to the fa 's long-serving president lord kinnaird . kinnaird died in 1923 , and his family kept it in their possession , out of view , until putting it up for auction in 2005 . it was duly sold at christie 's auction house on 19 may 2005 for £420,000 ( £478,400 including auction fees and taxes ) . the sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia , surpassing the £254,000 paid for the jules rimet world cup trophy in 1997 . the successful bidder was david gold , the then joint chairman of birmingham city ; claiming the fa and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country , gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation . accordingly , gold presented the trophy to the national football museum in preston on 20 april 2006 , where it went on immediate public display . it later moved with the museum to its new location in manchester . in november 2012 , it was ceremonially presented to royal engineers , after they beat wanderers 7–1 in a charity replay of the first fa cup final .
the light from leds can be modulated very quickly so they are used extensively in optical fiber and free space optics communications . this includes remote controls , such as for tvs , vcrs , and led computers , where infrared leds are often used . opto-isolators use an led combined with a photodiode or phototransistor to provide a signal path with electrical isolation between two circuits . this is especially useful in medical equipment where the signals from a low-voltage sensor circuit ( usually battery-powered ) in contact with a living organism must be electrically isolated from any possible electrical failure in a recording or monitoring device operating at potentially dangerous voltages . an optoisolator also allows information to be transferred between circuits not sharing a common ground potential .
between the 16th century and 19th century , the traditional armenian homeland composed of eastern armenia and western armenia came under the rule of the ottoman and successive iranian empires , repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries . by the 19th century , eastern armenia had been conquered by the russian empire , while most of the western parts of the traditional armenian homeland remained under ottoman rule . during world war i , armenians living in their ancestral lands in the ottoman empire were systematically exterminated in the armenian genocide . in 1918 , after the russian revolution , all non-russian countries declared their independence from the russian empire , leading to the establishment of the first republic of armenia . by 1920 , the state was incorporated into the transcaucasian socialist federative soviet republic , and in 1922 became a founding member of the soviet union . in 1936 , the transcaucasian state was dissolved , transforming its constituent states , including the armenian soviet socialist republic , into full union republics . the modern republic of armenia became independent in 1991 during the dissolution of the soviet union .
britain now threatened to withdraw its subsidies if prussia did n't consider offering concessions to secure peace . as the prussian armies had dwindled to just 60,000 men and with berlin itself under siege , frederick 's survival was severely threatened . then on 5 january 1762 the russian empress elizabeth died . her prussophile successor , peter iii , at once recalled russian armies from berlin ( see : the treaty of saint petersburg ( 1762 ) ) and mediated frederick 's truce with sweden . he also placed a corps of his own troops under frederick 's command this turn of events has become known as the miracle of the house of brandenburg . frederick was then able to muster a larger army of 120,000 men and concentrate it against austria . he drove them from much of saxony , while his brother henry won a victory in silesia in the battle of freiberg ( 29 october 1762 ) . at the same time , his brunswick allies captured the key town of göttingen and compounded this by taking cassel .
the trophy comes in three parts - the cup itself , plus a lid and a base . there have been two designs of trophy in use , but five physical trophies have been presented . the original trophy , known as the " little tin idol " , was 18 inches high and made by martin , hall & co . it was stolen in 1895 and never recovered , and so was replaced by an exact replica , used until 1910 . the fa decided to change the design after the 1909 winners , manchester united , made their own replica , leading the fa to realise they did not own the copyright . this new , larger design was by messers fattorini and sons , and was used from 1911 . in order to preserve this original , from 1992 it was replaced by an exact replica , although this had to be replaced after just over two decades , after showing wear and tear from being handled more than in previous eras . this third replica , first used in 2014 , was built heavier to withstand the increased handling . of the four surviving trophies , only the 1895 replica has entered private ownership .
during the rule of the succeeding hanoverian dynasty , power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government . the first hanoverian monarch , george i , relied on his ministers to a greater extent than did previous monarchs . later hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation : george iii and george iv both openly opposed catholic emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a catholic emancipation bill would violate the coronation oath , which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established church of england from papal domination and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy . however , george iv reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers . thus , as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved , the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse , both in the united kingdom and in the other commonwealth realms .
during the cretaceous , the late paleozoic-early mesozoic supercontinent of pangaea completed its breakup into present day continents , although their positions were substantially different at the time . as the atlantic ocean widened , the convergent-margin orogenies that had begun during the jurassic continued in the north american cordillera , as the nevadan orogeny was followed by the sevier and laramide orogenies . though gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the cretaceous , gondwana itself broke up as south america , antarctica and australia rifted away from africa ( though india and madagascar remained attached to each other ) ; thus , the south atlantic and indian oceans were newly formed . such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts , raising eustatic sea levels worldwide .
when it comes to civil and criminal cases , the bundesgerichtshof is at the top of the hierarchy of courts . the other branches of the german judicial system each have their own appellate systems , each topped by a high court ; these are the bundessozialgericht for matters of social security , the bundesarbeitsgericht for employment and labour , the bundesfinanzhof for taxation and financial issues , and the bundesverwaltungsgericht for administrative law . the so-called gemeinsamer senat der obersten gerichtshöfe ( joint senate of the supreme courts ) is not a supreme court in itself , but an ad-hoc body that is convened in only when one supreme court intends to diverge from another supreme court 's legal opinion or when a certain case exceeds the authority of one court . as the courts have well-defined areas of responsibility , situations like these are rather rare and so , the joint senate gathers very infrequently , and only to consider matters which are mostly definitory .
the houston theater district , located downtown , is home to nine major performing arts organizations and six performance halls . it is the second-largest concentration of theater seats in a downtown area in the united states . houston is one of few united states cities with permanent , professional , resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines : opera ( houston grand opera ) , ballet ( houston ballet ) , music ( houston symphony orchestra ) , and theater ( the alley theatre ) . houston is also home to folk artists , art groups and various small progressive arts organizations . houston attracts many touring broadway acts , concerts , shows , and exhibitions for a variety of interests . facilities in the theater district include the jones hall—home of the houston symphony orchestra and society for the performing arts—and the hobby center for the performing arts .
defensive counterair ( dca ) is defined as " all the defensive measures designed to detect , identify , intercept , and destroy or negate enemy forces attempting to penetrate or attack through friendly airspace " ( jp 1-02 ) . a major goal of dca operations , in concert with oca operations , is to provide an area from which forces can operate , secure from air and missile threats . the dca mission comprises both active and passive defense measures . active defense is " the employment of limited offensive action and counterattacks to deny a contested area or position to the enemy " ( jp 1-02 ) . it includes both ballistic missile defense and air breathing threat defense , and encompasses point defense , area defense , and high value airborne asset defense . passive defense is " measures taken to reduce the probability of and to minimize the effects of damage caused by hostile action without the intention of taking the initiative " ( jp 1-02 ) . it includes detection and warning ; chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear defense ; camouflage , concealment , and deception ; hardening ; reconstitution ; dispersion ; redundancy ; and mobility , counter-measures , and stealth .
located in jacksonville , marine corps base camp lejeune , combined with nearby bases marine corps air station ( mcas ) cherry point , mcas new river , camp geiger , camp johnson , stone bay and courthouse bay , makes up the largest concentration of marines and sailors in the world . mcas cherry point is home of the 2nd marine aircraft wing . located in goldsboro , seymour johnson air force base is home of the 4th fighter wing and 916th air refueling wing . one of the busiest air stations in the united states coast guard is located at the coast guard air station in elizabeth city . also stationed in north carolina is the military ocean terminal sunny point in southport .
carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of armenian women , including many armenian families . prominent karabakh carpet weavers there were men too . the oldest extant armenian carpet from the region , referred to as artsakh ( see also karabakh carpet ) during the medieval era , is from the village of banants ( near gandzak ) and dates to the early 13th century . the first time that the armenian word for carpet , gorg , was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 armenian inscription on the wall of the kaptavan church in artsakh .
ship transport is an important component of melbourne 's transport system . the port of melbourne is australia 's largest container and general cargo port and also its busiest . the port handled two million shipping containers in a 12-month period during 2007 , making it one of the top five ports in the southern hemisphere . station pier on port phillip bay is the main passenger ship terminal with cruise ships and the spirit of tasmania ferries which cross bass strait to tasmania docking there . ferries and water taxis run from berths along the yarra river as far upstream as south yarra and across port phillip bay .
compaq , who had previously held the third place spot among pc manufacturers during the 1980s and early-mid 1990s , initiated a successful price war in 1994 that vaulted them to the biggest by the year end , overtaking a struggling ibm and relegating apple to third place . apple 's market share further struggled due to the release of the windows 95 operating system , which unified microsoft 's formerly separate ms-dos and windows products . windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of ibm pc compatible computers , and brought the capabilities of windows to parity with the mac os gui .
in 1887 , the british empire celebrated victoria 's golden jubilee . victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 june with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited . the following day , she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in westminster abbey . by this time , victoria was once again extremely popular . two days later on 23 june , she engaged two indian muslims as waiters , one of whom was abdul karim . he was soon promoted to " munshi " : teaching her hindustani , and acting as a clerk . her family and retainers were appalled , and accused abdul karim of spying for the muslim patriotic league , and biasing the queen against the hindus . equerry frederick ponsonby ( the son of sir henry ) discovered that the munshi had lied about his parentage , and reported to lord elgin , viceroy of india , " the munshi occupies very much the same position as john brown used to do . " victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice . abdul karim remained in her service until he returned to india with a pension on her death .

on november 18 , 1990 , the ukrainian autocephalous orthodox church enthroned mstyslav as patriarch of kiev and all ukraine during ceremonies at saint sophia 's cathedral . also on november 18 , canada announced that its consul-general to kiev would be ukrainian-canadian nestor gayowsky . on november 19 , the united states announced that its consul to kiev would be ukrainian-american john stepanchuk . on november 19 , the chairmen of the ukrainian and russian parliaments , respectively , kravchuk and yeltsin , signed a 10-year bilateral pact . in early december 1990 the party of democratic rebirth of ukraine was founded ; on december 15 , the democratic party of ukraine was founded .
serious financial damage has been caused by security breaches , but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident , the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved . " several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general . the 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $ 13 billion ( worms and viruses only ) to $ 226 billion ( for all forms of covert attacks ) . the reliability of these estimates is often challenged ; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal . "
since the industrial revolution some two hundred years ago , the food processing industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature . cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness , whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled . these latter technologies include pasteurisation , autoclavation , drying , salting , and separation of various components , all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food . pasteurisation and autoclavation ( heating techniques ) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods , preventing epidemics of bacterial infection . but some of the ( new ) food processing technologies have downfalls as well .
sensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived . the ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation , or memorization , is the example of sensory memory . it is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response . with very short presentations , participants often report that they seem to " see " more than they can actually report . the first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by george sperling ( 1963 ) using the " partial report paradigm " . subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters , arranged into three rows of four . after a brief presentation , subjects were then played either a high , medium or low tone , cuing them which of the rows to report . based on these partial report experiments , sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items , but that it degraded very quickly ( within a few hundred milliseconds ) . because this form of memory degrades so quickly , participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items ( 12 in the " whole report " procedure ) before they decayed . this type of memory can not be prolonged via rehearsal .
their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made these mediterranean universities similar to islamic madrasas , although madrasas were generally smaller and individual teachers , rather than the madrasa itself , granted the license or degree . scholars like arnold h. green and hossein nasr have argued that starting in the 10th century , some medieval islamic madrasahs became universities . george makdisi and others , however , argue that the european university has no parallel in the medieval islamic world . other scholars regard the university as uniquely european in origin and characteristics .
his best known wife was jovanka broz . tito was just shy of his 59th birthday , while she was 27 , when they finally married in april 1952 , with state security chief aleksandar ranković as the best man . their eventual marriage came about somewhat unexpectedly since tito actually rejected her some years earlier when his confidante ivan krajacic brought her in originally . at that time , she was in her early 20s and tito , objecting to her energetic personality , opted for the more mature opera singer zinka kunc instead . not one to be discouraged easily , jovanka continued working at beli dvor , where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance after tito 's strange relationship with zinka failed . since jovanka was the only female companion he married while in power , she also went down in history as yugoslavia 's first lady . their relationship was not a happy one , however . it had gone through many , often public , ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a coup d'état by the latter pair . certain unofficial reports suggest tito and jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s , shortly before his death . however , during tito 's funeral she was officially present as his wife , and later claimed rights for inheritance . the couple did not have any children .
areas that should not be soldered may be covered with solder resist ( solder mask ) . one of the most common solder resists used today is called " lpi " ( liquid photoimageable solder mask ) . a photo-sensitive coating is applied to the surface of the pwb , then exposed to light through the solder mask image film , and finally developed where the unexposed areas are washed away . dry film solder mask is similar to the dry film used to image the pwb for plating or etching . after being laminated to the pwb surface it is imaged and develop as lpi . once common but no longer commonly used because of its low accuracy and resolution is to screen print epoxy ink . solder resist also provides protection from the environment .
according to the rev . john gulick : " the inhabitants of other asiatic nations , who have had occasion to represent the words of their several languages by chinese characters , have as a rule used unaspirated characters for the sounds , g , d , b . the muslims from arabia and persia have followed this method … the mongols , manchu , and japanese also constantly select unaspirated characters to represent the sounds g , d , b , and j of their languages . these surrounding asiatic nations , in writing chinese words in their own alphabets , have uniformly used g , d , b , & c. , to represent the unaspirated sounds . "
law enforcement , however , constitutes only part of policing activity . policing has included an array of activities in different situations , but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order . in some societies , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property . many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree . the police force is usually a public sector service , meaning they are paid through taxes .
after a death sentence is affirmed in state collateral review , the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus , which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts . federal habeas corpus is a species of collateral review , and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court ( other than petitions for certiorari to the united states supreme court after both direct review and state collateral review ) . the scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 , which restricted significantly its previous scope . the purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts , through the process of direct review and state collateral review , have done at least a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner 's federal constitutional rights . prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime , though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process , evidence of innocence must be truly compelling .
in july 2015 , eton accidentally sent emails to 400 prospective students , offering them conditional entrance to the school in september 2017 . the email was intended for nine students , but an it glitch caused the email to be sent to 400 additional families , who did n't necessarily have a place . in response , the school issued the following statement : " this error was discovered within minutes and each family was immediately contacted to notify them that it should be disregarded and to apologise . we take this type of incident very seriously indeed and so a thorough investigation , overseen by the headmaster tony little and led by the tutor for admissions , is being carried out to find out exactly what went wrong and ensure it can not happen again . eton college offers its sincere apologies to those boys concerned and their families . we deeply regret the confusion and upset this must have caused .

compact disc ( cd ) is a digital optical disc data storage format . the format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data ( cd-rom ) . several other formats were further derived from these , including write-once audio and data storage ( cd-r ) , rewritable media ( cd-rw ) , video compact disc ( vcd ) , super video compact disc ( svcd ) , photo cd , picturecd , cd-i , and enhanced music cd . audio cds and audio cd players have been commercially available since october 1982 .
the climate of the coastal plain is influenced by the atlantic ocean , which keeps conditions mild in winter and moderate , although humid , in summer . the highest coastal , daytime temperature averages less than 89 °f ( 32 °c ) during summer months . the coast has mild temperatures in winter , with daytime highs rarely below 40 °f ( 4 °c ) . the average daytime temperature in the coastal plain is usually in the mid-50s °f ( 11–14 °c ) in winter . temperatures in the coastal plain only occasionally drop below the freezing point at night . the coastal plain averages only around 1 inch ( 2.5 cm ) of snow or ice annually , and in many years , there may be no snow or ice at all .
insect respiration is accomplished without lungs . instead , the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped , delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea ( element 8 in numbered diagram ) . since oxygen is delivered directly , the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen , and is therefore greatly reduced . the insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries , and instead consists of little more than a single , perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically . toward the thorax , the dorsal tube ( element 14 ) divides into chambers and acts like the insect 's heart . the opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph , arthropods ' fluid analog of blood , inside the body cavity . :61–65 air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles .
french-speaking naturalists in several countries showed appreciation of the much modified french translation by clémence royer , but darwin 's ideas had little impact in france , where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of lamarckism . the intelligentsia in russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before darwin had published his theory , and scientists were quick to take it into account , although the malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant . the political economy of struggle was criticised as a british stereotype by karl marx and by leo tolstoy , who had the character levin in his novel anna karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of darwin 's views .
somalis ( somali : soomaali , arabic : صومال‎ ) are an ethnic group inhabiting the horn of africa ( somali peninsula ) . the overwhelming majority of somalis speak the somali language , which is part of the cushitic branch of the afro-asiatic family . they are predominantly sunni muslim . ethnic somalis number around 16-20 million and are principally concentrated in somalia ( around 12.3 million ) , ethiopia ( 4.6 million ) , kenya ( 2.4 million ) , and djibouti ( 464,600 ) , with many also residing in parts of the middle east , north america and europe .
according to the prevailing theories of the settlement of the americas , migrations of humans from asia ( in particular north asia ) to the americas took place via beringia , a land bridge which connected the two continents across what is now the bering strait . the majority of experts agree that the earliest pre-modern human migration via beringia took place at least 13,500 years ago , with disputed evidence that people had migrated into the americas much earlier , up to 40,000 years ago . these early paleo-indians spread throughout the americas , diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes . according to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the americas , they have been living there since their genesis , described by a wide range of creation myths .
historical narratives of manga tend to focus either on its recent , post-wwii history , or on attempts to demonstrates deep roots in the past , such as to the chōjū-jinbutsu-giga picture scroll of the 12th and 13th centuries , or the early 19th-century hokusai manga . the first historical overview of japanese comics was seiki hosokibara 's nihon manga-shi [ i ] in 1924 . early post-war japanese criticism was mostly of a left-wing political nature until the 1986 publication for tomofusa kure 's modern manga : the complete picture , [ j ] which de-emphasized politics in favour of formal aspects , such as structure and a " grammar " of comics . the field of manga studies increased rapidly , with numerous books on the subject appearing in the 1990s . formal theories of manga have focused on developing a " manga expression theory " , [ k ] with emphasis on spatial relationships in the structure of images on the page , distinguishing the medium from film or literature , in which the flow of time is the basic organizing element . comics studies courses have proliferated at japanese universities , and japan society for studies in cartoon and comics ( ja ) [ l ] was established in 2001 to promote comics scholarship . the publication of frederik l. schodt 's manga ! manga ! the world of japanese comics in 1983 led to the spread of use of the word manga outside japan to mean " japanese comics " or " japanese-style comics " .

switzerland has a dense network of cities , where large , medium and small cities are complementary . the plateau is very densely populated with about 450 people per km2 and the landscape continually shows signs of human presence . the weight of the largest metropolitan areas , which are zürich , geneva–lausanne , basel and bern tend to increase . in international comparison the importance of these urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests . in addition the two main centers of zürich and geneva are recognized for their particularly great quality of life .
sociologist james a. beckford , in his 1975 study of jehovah 's witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as totalizing , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of god 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that jehovah 's witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) .

under the capetian dynasty france slowly began to expand its authority over the nobility , growing out of the île-de-france to exert control over more of the country in the 11th and 12th centuries . they faced a powerful rival in the dukes of normandy , who in 1066 under william the conqueror ( duke 1035–1087 ) , conquered england ( r. 1066–87 ) and created a cross-channel empire that lasted , in various forms , throughout the rest of the middle ages . normans also settled in sicily and southern italy , when robert guiscard ( d. 1085 ) landed there in 1059 and established a duchy that later became the kingdom of sicily . under the angevin dynasty of henry ii ( r. 1154–89 ) and his son richard i ( r. 1189–99 ) , the kings of england ruled over england and large areas of france , [ w ] brought to the family by henry ii 's marriage to eleanor of aquitaine ( d. 1204 ) , heiress to much of southern france . [ x ] richard 's younger brother john ( r. 1199–1216 ) lost normandy and the rest of the northern french possessions in 1204 to the french king philip ii augustus ( r. 1180–1223 ) . this led to dissension among the english nobility , while john 's financial exactions to pay for his unsuccessful attempts to regain normandy led in 1215 to magna carta , a charter that confirmed the rights and privileges of free men in england . under henry iii ( r. 1216–72 ) , john 's son , further concessions were made to the nobility , and royal power was diminished . the french monarchy continued to make gains against the nobility during the late 12th and 13th centuries , bringing more territories within the kingdom under their personal rule and centralising the royal administration . under louis ix ( r. 1226–70 ) , royal prestige rose to new heights as louis served as a mediator for most of europe .

proponents of affirmative action argue that by nature the system is not only race based , but also class and gender based . to eliminate two of its key components would undermine the purpose of the entire system . the african american policy forum believes that the class based argument is based on the idea that non-poor minorities do not experience racial and gender based discrimination . the aapf believes that " race-conscious affirmative action remains necessary to address race-based obstacles that block the path to success of countless people of color of all classes " . the groups goes on to say that affirmative action is responsible for creating the african american middle class , so it does not make sense to say that the system only benefits the middle and upper classes .

uruguay 's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between manuel oribe and fructuoso rivera , the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the empire of brazil under the command of lavalleja , each of whom had become the caudillo of their respective faction . politics were divided between oribe 's blancos ( " whites " ) , represented by the national party , and rivera 's colorados ( " reds " ) , represented by the colorado party , with each party 's name taken from the colour of its emblems . in 1838 , oribe was forced to resign the presidency ; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war , the guerra grande , which lasted until 1851 .
some evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals . for example , sweden has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops . [ unreliable source ? ] in indonesia , farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65 % and experienced a 15 % crop increase . [ unreliable source ? ] a study of maize fields in northern florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high carbon to nitrogen ratio to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic nematodes and increasing crop yield , with yield increases ranging from 10 % to 212 % ; the observed effects were long-term , often not appearing until the third season of the study .
in 2008 , india suspended military aid to myanmar over the issue of human rights abuses by the ruling junta , although it has preserved extensive commercial ties , which provide the regime with much-needed revenue . the thaw in relations began on 28 november 2011 , when belarusian prime minister mikhail myasnikovich and his wife ludmila arrived in the capital , naypyidaw , the same day as the country received a visit by us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton , who also met with pro-democracy opposition leader aung san suu kyi . international relations progress indicators continued in september 2012 when aung san suu kyi visited to the us followed by myanmar 's reformist president visit to the united nations .
catalan shares many traits with its neighboring romance languages . however , despite being mostly situated in the iberian peninsula , catalan differs more from iberian romance ( such as spanish and portuguese ) in terms of vocabulary , pronunciation , and grammar than from gallo-romance ( occitan , french , gallo-italic languages , etc. ) . these similarities are most notable with occitan .
glaciers pick up rocks and sediment with them as they flow . this causes erosion and the formation of valleys over time . the inn valley is an example of a valley carved by glaciers during the ice ages with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion . eroded rocks from the most recent ice age lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of erosion from earlier ice ages . glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls ( reliefs ) ; valleys with lower reliefs and talus slopes are remnants of glacial troughs or previously infilled valleys . moraines , piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier , accumulate at edges , center and the terminus of glaciers .
after the english civil war the royal citadel was built in 1666 on the east end of plymouth hoe , to defend the port from naval attacks , suppress plymothian parliamentary leanings and to train the armed forces . guided tours are available in the summer months . further west is smeaton 's tower , which was built in 1759 as a lighthouse on rocks 14 miles ( 23 km ) off shore , but dismantled and the top two thirds rebuilt on the hoe in 1877 . it is open to the public and has views over the plymouth sound and the city from the lantern room . plymouth has 20 war memorials of which nine are on the hoe including : plymouth naval memorial , to remember those killed in world wars i and ii , and the armada memorial , to commemorate the defeat of the spanish armada .
there is an environmental program , called hoy no circula ( " today does not run " , or " one day without a car " ) , whereby vehicles that have not passed emissions testing are restricted from circulating on certain days according to the ending digit of their license plates ; this in an attempt to cut down on pollution and traffic congestion . while in 2003 , the program still restricted 40 % of vehicles in the metropolitan area , with the adoption of stricter emissions standards in 2001 and 2006 , in practice , these days most vehicles are exempt from the circulation restrictions as long as they pass regular emissions tests .
the western section of the state is part of the appalachian mountain range . among the subranges of the appalachians located in the state are the great smoky mountains , blue ridge mountains , great balsam mountains , and black mountains . the black mountains are the highest in the eastern united states , and culminate in mount mitchell at 6,684 feet ( 2,037 m ) the highest point east of the mississippi river . although agriculture still remains important , tourism has become a dominant industry in the mountains . growing christmas trees has recently become an important industry as well . because of the higher altitude , the climate in the mountains often differs markedly from that of the rest of the state . winter in western north carolina typically features high snowfall and subfreezing temperatures more akin to those of a midwestern state than of a southern state .
public institutions of higher education in charleston include the college of charleston ( the nation 's 13th-oldest university ) , the citadel , the military college of south carolina , and the medical university of south carolina . the city is also home to private universities , including the charleston school of law . charleston is also home to the roper hospital school of practical nursing , and the city has a downtown satellite campus for the region 's technical school , trident technical college . charleston is also the location for the only college in the country that offers bachelor 's degrees in the building arts , the american college of the building arts . the art institute of charleston , located downtown on north market street , opened in 2007 .
in styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . the most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the french invader . he has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled rubik 's cubes . although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in mosaic styles as well .
marine mammals are many , such as the dolphins , porpoises and whales , which are seen here during the migration period from december till may . turtles are a common sight along the coastline of the island . they are a protected species and in the endangered list . it is stated that it will take 15–50 years for this species to attain reproductive age . though they live in the sea , the females come to the shore to lay eggs and are protected by private societies . three species of turtles are particularly notable . these are : the leatherback sea turtles which have leather skin instead of a shell and are the largest of the type found here , some times measuring a much as 3 m ( average is about 1.5 m ) and weighing about 450 kg ( jellyfish is their favourite diet ) ; the hawksbill turtles , which have hawk-like beaks and found near reefs , generally about 90 cm in diameter and weigh about 60 kg and their diet consists of crabs and snails ; and the green turtles , herbivores which have rounded heads , generally about 90 cm in diameter and live amidst tall sea grasses .
the ottoman empire or , as a dynastic institution , the house of osman was unprecedented and unequaled in the islamic world for its size and duration . in europe , only the house of habsburg had a similarly unbroken line of sovereigns ( kings/emperors ) from the same family who ruled for so long , and during the same period , between the late 13th and early 20th centuries . the ottoman dynasty was turkish in origin . on eleven occasions , the sultan was deposed ( replaced by another sultan of the ottoman dynasty , who were either the former sultan 's brother , son or nephew ) because he was perceived by his enemies as a threat to the state . there were only two attempts in ottoman history to unseat the ruling ottoman dynasty , both failures , which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability . as such , the last ottoman sultan mehmed vi ( r. 1918–1922 ) was a direct patrilineal ( male-line ) descendant of the first ottoman sultan osman i ( r. 1299–1326 ) , which was unparallelled in both europe ( e.g . the male line of the house of habsburg became extinct in 1740 ) and in the islamic world . the primary purpose of the imperial harem was to ensure the birth of male heirs to the ottoman throne and secure the continuation of the direct patrilineal ( male-line ) descendance of the ottoman sultans .
philadelphia artists have had a prominent national role in popular music . in the 1970s , philadelphia soul influenced the music of that and later eras . on july 13 , 1985 , philadelphia hosted the american end of the live aid concert at john f. kennedy stadium . the city reprised this role for the live 8 concert , bringing some 700,000 people to the ben franklin parkway on july 2 , 2005 . philadelphia is home to the world-renowned philadelphia boys choir & chorale , which has performed its music all over the world . dr. robert g. hamilton , founder of the choir , is a notable native philadelphian . the philly pops is another famous philadelphia music group . the city has played a major role in the development and support of american rock music and rap music . hip-hop/rap artists such as the roots , dj jazzy jeff & the fresh prince , the goats , freeway , schoolly d , eve , and lisa " left eye " lopes hail from the city .
after christianization , the roman catholic church and local rulers led german expansion and settlement in areas inhabited by slavs and balts , known as ostsiedlung . during the wars waged in the baltic by the catholic german teutonic knights ; the lands inhabited by the ethnic group of the old prussians ( the current reference to the people known then simply as the " prussians " ) , were conquered by the germans . the old prussians were an ethnic group related to the latvian and lithuanian baltic peoples . the former german state of prussia took its name from the baltic prussians , although it was led by germans who had assimilated the old prussians ; the old prussian language was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century . the slavic people of the teutonic-controlled baltic were assimilated into german culture and eventually there were many intermarriages of slavic and german families , including amongst the prussia 's aristocracy known as the junkers . prussian military strategist karl von clausewitz is a famous german whose surname is of slavic origin . massive german settlement led to the assimilation of baltic ( old prussians ) and slavic ( wends ) populations , who were exhausted by previous warfare .
several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics . the issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the us interagency task force on antimicrobial resistance . this task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance , and is coordinated by the us centers for disease control and prevention , the food and drug administration ( fda ) , and the national institutes of health ( nih ) , as well as other us agencies . an ngo campaign group is keep antibiotics working . in france , an " antibiotics are not automatic " government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions , especially in children .
political boundaries drawn by the british did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions , contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas . the british empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples . millions left the british isles , with the founding settler populations of the united states , canada , australia and new zealand coming mainly from britain and ireland . tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities , and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in south africa and zimbabwe . settlers in ireland from great britain have left their mark in the form of divided nationalist and unionist communities in northern ireland . millions of people moved to and from british colonies , with large numbers of indians emigrating to other parts of the empire , such as malaysia and fiji , and chinese people to malaysia , singapore and the caribbean . the demographics of britain itself was changed after the second world war owing to immigration to britain from its former colonies .
sanskrit ( /ˈsænskrɪt/ ; sanskrit : saṃskṛtam [ səmskr̩t̪əm ] or saṃskṛta , originally saṃskṛtā vāk , " refined speech " ) is the primary sacred language of hinduism , a philosophical language in buddhism , hinduism , sikhism and jainism , and a literary language that was in use as a lingua franca in greater india . it is a standardised dialect of old indo-aryan , originating as vedic sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to proto-indo-iranian and proto-indo-european . today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of india and is an official language of the state of uttarakhand . as one of the oldest indo-european languages for which substantial written documentation exists , sanskrit holds a prominent position in indo-european studies .

the initial near-complete mpeg-1 standard ( parts 1 , 2 and 3 ) was publicly available on 6 december 1991 as iso cd 11172 . in most countries , patents can not be filed after prior art has been made public , and patents expire 20 years after the initial filing date , which can be up to 12 months later for filings in other countries . as a result , patents required to implement mp3 expired in most countries by december 2012 , 21 years after the publication of iso cd 11172 .
the elimination of wolves from yellowstone national park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid . without predation , herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species , affecting the area 's plant populations . in addition , wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas , which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon . the removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations , as their habitat became territory for grazing . furthermore , predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order . increased browsing on willows and conifers along blacktail creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place .
after being lit at the birthplace of the olympic games in olympia , greece on march 24 , the torch traveled to the panathinaiko stadium in athens , and then to beijing , arriving on march 31 . from beijing , the torch was following a route passing through six continents . the torch has visited cities along the silk road , symbolizing ancient links between china and the rest of the world . the relay also included an ascent with the flame to the top of mount everest on the border of nepal and tibet , china from the chinese side , which was closed specially for the event .
throughout history there have been a series of lingua francas in the area to allow for better communication . the dialects spoken in hangzhou , shaoxing , and ningbo have taken on this role historically . since the founding of the people 's republic of china in 1949 , mandarin , which is not mutually intelligible with any of the local dialects , has been promoted as the standard language of communication throughout china . as a result , most of the population now can , to some degree , speak and comprehend mandarin and can code-switch when necessary . a majority of the population educated since 1978 can speak mandarin . urban residents tend to be more fluent in mandarin than rural people . nevertheless , a zhejiang accent is detectable in almost everyone from the area communicating in mandarin , and the home dialect remains an important part of the everyday lives and cultural identities of most zhejiang residents .
adolescence ( from latin adolescere , meaning " to grow up " ) is a transitional stage of physical and psychological human development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood ( age of majority ) . the period of adolescence is most closely associated with the teenage years , though its physical , psychological and cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later . for example , although puberty has been historically associated with the onset of adolescent development , it now typically begins prior to the teenage years and there has been a normative shift of it occurring in preadolescence , particularly in females ( see precocious puberty ) . physical growth , as distinct from puberty ( particularly in males ) , and cognitive development generally seen in adolescence , can also extend into the early twenties . thus chronological age provides only a rough marker of adolescence , and scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise definition of adolescence .
humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions to environmental hazards . examples include : space suits , air conditioned clothing , armor , diving suits , swimsuits , bee-keeper gear , motorcycle leathers , high-visibility clothing , and other pieces of protective clothing . meanwhile , the distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut—since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design . wearing clothes also has social implications . they cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered , act as a form of adornment , and serve other social purposes .
although anthropologists worldwide refer to tylor 's definition of culture , in the 20th century " culture " emerged as the central and unifying concept of american anthropology , where it most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human experiences symbolically , and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially . [ citation needed ] american anthropology is organized into four fields , each of which plays an important role in research on culture : biological anthropology , linguistic anthropology , cultural anthropology , and archaeology .
chickens raised intensively for their meat are known as " broilers " . breeds have been developed that can grow to an acceptable carcass size ( 2 kg ( 4.4 lb ) ) in six weeks or less . broilers grow so fast , their legs can not always support their weight and their hearts and respiratory systems may not be able to supply enough oxygen to their developing muscles . mortality rates at 1 % are much higher than for less-intensively reared laying birds which take 18 weeks to reach similar weights . processing the birds is done automatically with conveyor-belt efficiency . they are hung by their feet , stunned , killed , bled , scalded , plucked , have their heads and feet removed , eviscerated , washed , chilled , drained , weighed , and packed , all within the course of little over two hours .
hydrogen production technologies been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s . aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells , several thermochemical processes have also been explored . one such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures ( 2,300–2,600 °c or 4,200–4,700 °f ) . another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the steam reformation of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods . thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production . the solzinc process under development at the weizmann institute uses a 1 mw solar furnace to decompose zinc oxide ( zno ) at temperatures above 1,200 °c ( 2,200 °f ) . this initial reaction produces pure zinc , which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen .
although the palaeologi emperors recaptured constantinople from the western europeans in 1261 , they were never able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands . they usually controlled only a small section of the balkan peninsula near constantinople , the city itself , and some coastal lands on the black sea and around the aegean sea . the former byzantine lands in the balkans were divided between the new kingdom of serbia , the second bulgarian empire and the city-state of venice . the power of the byzantine emperors was threatened by a new turkish tribe , the ottomans , who established themselves in anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century . the ottomans expanded into europe , reducing bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over serbia after its defeat at the battle of kosovo in 1389 . western europeans rallied to the plight of the christians in the balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396 ; a great army was sent to the balkans , where it was defeated at the battle of nicopolis . constantinople was finally captured by the ottomans in 1453 .
glass-ceramic materials share many properties with both non-crystalline glass and crystalline ceramics . they are formed as a glass , and then partially crystallized by heat treatment . for example , the microstructure of whiteware ceramics frequently contains both amorphous and crystalline phases . crystalline grains are often embedded within a non-crystalline intergranular phase of grain boundaries . when applied to whiteware ceramics , vitreous means the material has an extremely low permeability to liquids , often but not always water , when determined by a specified test regime .
in 1983 fighting between palestinian refugees and lebanese factions reignited that nation 's long-running civil war . a un agreement brought an international force of peacekeepers to occupy beirut and guarantee security . us marines landed in august 1982 along with italian and french forces . on october 23 , 1983 , a suicide bomber driving a truck filled with 6 tons of tnt crashed through a fence and destroyed the marine barracks , killing 241 marines ; seconds later , a second bomber leveled a french barracks , killing 58 . subsequently the us navy engaged in bombing of militia positions inside lebanon . while us president ronald reagan was initially defiant , political pressure at home eventually forced the withdrawal of the marines in february 1984 .
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 , a state prisoner is ordinarily only allowed one suit for habeas corpus in federal court . if the federal courts refuse to issue a writ of habeas corpus , an execution date may be set . in recent times , however , prisoners have postponed execution through a final round of federal litigation using the civil rights act of 1871 — codified at 42 u.s.c . § 1983 — which allows people to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights .
the gothic vault , unlike the semi-circular vault of roman and romanesque buildings , can be used to roof rectangular and irregularly shaped plans such as trapezoids . the other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle . this enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in romanesque architecture . while , structurally , use of the pointed arch gave a greater flexibility to architectural form , it also gave gothic architecture a very different and more vertical visual character than romanesque .
upon the invitation of duke konrad i of masovia , the teutonic knights took possession of prussia in the 13th century and created a monastic state to administer the conquered old prussians . local old-prussian ( north ) and polish ( south ) toponyms were gradually germanised . the knights ' expansionist policies , including occupation of polish pomerania with gdańsk/danzig and western lithuania , brought them into conflict with the kingdom of poland and embroiled them in several wars , culminating in the polish-lithuanian-teutonic war , whereby the united armies of poland and lithuania , defeated the teutonic order at the battle of grunwald ( tannenberg ) in 1410 . its defeat was formalised in the second treaty of thorn in 1466 ending the thirteen years ' war , and leaving the former polish region pomerania/pomerelia under polish control . together with warmia it formed the province of royal prussia . eastern prussia remained under the knights , but as a fief of poland . 1466 and 1525 arrangements by kings of poland were not verified by the holy roman empire as well as the previous gains of the teutonic knights were not verified .
a notable pattern that developed during the 2000s and 2010s has been for certain pop songs to have lengthy runs on ac charts , even after the songs have fallen off the hot 100 . adrian moreira , senior vice president for adult music for rca music group , said , " we 've seen a fairly tidal shift in what ac will play " . rather than emphasizing older songs , adult contemporary was playing many of the same songs as top 40 and adult top 40 , but only after the hits had become established . an article on mtv 's website by corey moss describes this trend : " in other words , ac stations are where pop songs go to die a very long death . or , to optimists , to get a second life . "
jesuit missionary eusebio francisco kino visited the santa cruz river valley in 1692 , and founded the mission san xavier del bac in 1700 about 7 mi ( 11 km ) upstream from the site of the settlement of tucson . a separate convento settlement was founded downstream along the santa cruz river , near the base of what is now " a " mountain . hugo o'conor , the founding father of the city of tucson , arizona authorized the construction of a military fort in that location , presidio san agustín del tucsón , on august 20 , 1775 ( near the present downtown pima county courthouse ) . during the spanish period of the presidio , attacks such as the second battle of tucson were repeatedly mounted by apaches . eventually the town came to be called " tucson " and became a part of sonora after mexico gained independence from spain in 1821 .
hydropower is produced in 150 countries , with the asia-pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010 . china is the largest hydroelectricity producer , with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010 , representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use . there are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 gw : the three gorges dam in china , itaipu dam across the brazil/paraguay border , and guri dam in venezuela . the cost of hydroelectricity is low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity . the average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 u.s. cents per kilowatt-hour .
west 's life took a different direction when his mother , donda west , died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving abdominoplasty and breast reduction in november 2007 . months later , west and fiancée alexis phifer ended their engagement and their long-term intermittent relationship , which had begun in 2002 . the events profoundly affected west , who set off for his 2008 glow in the dark tour shortly thereafter . purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping , west decided to sing using the voice audio processor auto-tune , which would become a central part of his next effort . west had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album the college dropout for the background vocals of " jesus walks " and " never let me down . " recorded mostly in honolulu , hawaii in three weeks , west announced his fourth album , 808s & heartbreak , at the 2008 mtv video music awards , where he performed its lead single , " love lockdown " . music audiences were taken aback by the uncharacteristic production style and the presence of auto-tune , which typified the pre-release response to the record .
part of the haunted mansion attraction at disneyland in anaheim , california , and disneyland in paris , france , takes place on an elevator . the " stretching room " on the ride is actually an elevator that travels downwards , giving access to a short underground tunnel which leads to the rest of the attraction . the elevator has no ceiling and its shaft is decorated to look like walls of a mansion . because there is no roof , passengers are able to see the walls of the shaft by looking up , which gives the illusion of the room stretching .
the russian army withdrew and retreated past moscow . napoleon entered the city , assuming its fall would end the war and alexander would negotiate peace . however , on orders of the city 's governor feodor rostopchin , rather than capitulation , moscow was burned . after five weeks , napoleon and his army left . in early november napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in france after the malet coup of 1812 . his army walked through snow up to their knees and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 november alone . after battle of berezina napoleon succeeded to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train . on 5 december , shortly before arriving in vilnius , napoleon left the army in a sledge .
though most computers since mid-2004 can boot from usb mass storage devices , usb is not intended as a primary bus for a computer 's internal storage . buses such as parallel ata ( pata or ide ) , serial ata ( sata ) , or scsi fulfill that role in pc class computers . however , usb has one important advantage , in that it is possible to install and remove devices without rebooting the computer ( hot-swapping ) , making it useful for mobile peripherals , including drives of various kinds ( given sata or scsi devices may or may not support hot-swapping ) .
starting in 1984 , some of these djs , inspired by jesse saunders ' success with " on and on " , tried their hand at producing and releasing original compositions . these compositions used newly affordable electronic instruments to emulate not just saunders ' song , but the edited , enhanced styles of disco and other dance music they already favored . these homegrown productions were played on chicago-area radio and in local discothèques catering mainly to african-american and gay audiences . by 1985 , although the exact origins of the term are debated , " house music " encompassed these locally produced recordings . subgenres of house , including deep house and acid house , quickly emerged and gained traction .
the usa patriot act of october 2001 dramatically reduces restrictions on law enforcement agencies ' ability to search telephone , e-mail communications , medical , financial , and other records ; eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the united states ; expands the secretary of the treasury 's authority to regulate financial transactions , particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities ; and broadens the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts . the act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism , thus enlarging the number of activities to which the usa patriot act 's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied . a new terrorist finance tracking program monitored the movements of terrorists ' financial resources ( discontinued after being revealed by the new york times ) . global telecommunication usage , including those with no links to terrorism , is being collected and monitored through the nsa electronic surveillance program . the patriot act is still in effect .
on 10 january 1941 , germany and the soviet union signed an agreement settling several ongoing issues . secret protocols in the new agreement modified the " secret additional protocols " of the german–soviet boundary and friendship treaty , ceding the lithuanian strip to the soviet union in exchange for 7.5 million dollars ( 31.5 million reichsmark ) . the agreement formally set the border between germany and the soviet union between the igorka river and the baltic sea . it also extended trade regulation of the 1940 german–soviet commercial agreement until august 1 , 1942 , increased deliveries above the levels of year one of that agreement , settled trading rights in the baltics and bessarabia , calculated the compensation for german property interests in the baltic states now occupied by the soviets and other issues . it also covered the migration to germany within two and a half months of ethnic germans and german citizens in soviet-held baltic territories , and the migration to the soviet union of baltic and " white russian " " nationals " in german-held territories .
apollo 11 left lunar orbit and returned to earth , landing safely in the pacific ocean on july 24 , 1969 . when the spacecraft splashed down , 2,982 days had passed since kennedy 's commitment to landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth before the end of the decade ; the mission was completed with 161 days to spare . with the safe completion of the apollo 11 mission , the americans won the race to the moon .
during world war ii he worked on the manhattan project with j. robert oppenheimer and edward teller , developing the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon . after the war , he served on the general advisory committee of the united states atomic energy commission , and later as one of its commissioners . he was a consultant to a number of organizations , including the united states air force , the armed forces special weapons project , and the lawrence livermore national laboratory . along with theoretical physicist edward teller , mathematician stanislaw ulam , and others , he worked out key steps in the nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb .
writing to a friend in may 1795 , burke surveyed the causes of discontent : " i think i can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of protestant ascendency , as they affect ireland ; or of indianism [ i.e . corporate tyranny , as practiced by the british east indies company ] , as they affect these countries , and as they affect asia ; or of jacobinism , as they affect all europe , and the state of human society itself . the last is the greatest evil " . by march 1796 , however burke had changed his mind : " our government and our laws are beset by two different enemies , which are sapping its foundations , indianism , and jacobinism . in some cases they act separately , in some they act in conjunction : but of this i am sure ; that the first is the worst by far , and the hardest to deal with ; and for this amongst other reasons , that it weakens discredits , and ruins that force , which ought to be employed with the greatest credit and energy against the other ; and that it furnishes jacobinism with its strongest arms against all formal government " .
ibm also had their own dbms in 1966 , known as information management system ( ims ) . ims was a development of software written for the apollo program on the system/360 . ims was generally similar in concept to codasyl , but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of codasyl 's network model . both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed , and bachman 's 1973 turing award presentation was the programmer as navigator . ims is classified [ by whom ? ] as a hierarchical database . idms and cincom systems ' total database are classified as network databases . ims remains in use as of 2014 [ update ] .
after morsi was ousted by the military , the judiciary system aligned itself with the new government , actively suopporting the repression of muslim brotherhood members . this resulted in a sharp increase in mass death sentences that arose criticism from the us president barack obama and the general secretary of the un , ban ki moon . in april 2013 , one judge of the minya governatorate of upper egypt , sentenced 1,212 people to death . in december 2014 the judge mohammed nagi shahata , notorious for his fierceness in passing on death sentences , condemened to the capital penalty 188 members of the muslim brotherhood , for assaulting a police station . various egyptian and international human rights organisations have already pointed out the lack of fair trials , that often last only a few minutes and do not take into consideration the procedural standards of fair trials .
in 1808 bavarian educational commissioner friedrich immanuel niethammer coined the term humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in german secondary schools , and by 1836 the word " humanism " had been absorbed into the english language in this sense . the coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856 , when german historian and philologist georg voigt used humanism to describe renaissance humanism , the movement that flourished in the italian renaissance to revive classical learning , a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations , especially italy .
in 1887 , the british empire celebrated victoria 's golden jubilee . victoria marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 june with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited . the following day , she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in westminster abbey . by this time , victoria was once again extremely popular . two days later on 23 june , she engaged two indian muslims as waiters , one of whom was abdul karim . he was soon promoted to " munshi " : teaching her hindustani , and acting as a clerk . her family and retainers were appalled , and accused abdul karim of spying for the muslim patriotic league , and biasing the queen against the hindus . equerry frederick ponsonby ( the son of sir henry ) discovered that the munshi had lied about his parentage , and reported to lord elgin , viceroy of india , " the munshi occupies very much the same position as john brown used to do . " victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice . abdul karim remained in her service until he returned to india with a pension on her death .
the western parts of the bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges , running south to north . the west bronx has older apartment buildings , low income public housing complexes , multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as riverdale and fieldston . it includes new york city 's fourth largest park : van cortlandt park along the westchester-bronx border . the grand concourse , a wide boulevard , runs through it , north to south .
over three quarters of the student body has some proficiency in a second language ( numbering 107 languages in total ) . this is partially due to the fact that 45 percent of the student body at byu has been missionaries for lds church , and many of them learned a foreign language as part of their mission assignment . during any given semester , about one-third of the student body is enrolled in foreign language classes , a rate nearly four times the national average . byu offers courses in over 60 different languages , many with advanced courses that are seldom offered elsewhere . several of its language programs are the largest of their kind in the nation , the russian program being one example . the university was selected by the united states department of education as the location of the national middle east language resource center , making the school a hub for experts on that region . it was also selected as a center for international business education research , a function of which is to train business employees in international languages and relations .
a freight elevator , or goods lift , is an elevator designed to carry goods , rather than passengers . freight elevators are generally required to display a written notice in the car that the use by passengers is prohibited ( though not necessarily illegal ) , though certain freight elevators allow dual use through the use of an inconspicuous riser . in order for an elevator to be legal to carry passengers in some jurisdictions it must have a solid inner door . freight elevators are typically larger and capable of carrying heavier loads than a passenger elevator , generally from 2,300 to 4,500 kg . freight elevators may have manually operated doors , and often have rugged interior finishes to prevent damage while loading and unloading . although hydraulic freight elevators exist , electric elevators are more energy efficient for the work of freight lifting .

us troops participated in a un peacekeeping mission in somalia beginning in 1992 . by 1993 the us troops were augmented with rangers and special forces with the aim of capturing warlord mohamed farrah aidid , whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from pakistan . during a raid in downtown mogadishu , us troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the battle of mogadishu . eighteen american soldiers were killed , and a us television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob . somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated 1,000–5,000 total casualties during the conflict . after much public disapproval , american forces were quickly withdrawn by president bill clinton . the incident profoundly affected us thinking about peacekeeping and intervention . the book black hawk down was written about the battle , and was the basis for the later movie of the same name .
the life cycles of insects vary but most hatch from eggs . insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts . the immature stages can differ from the adults in structure , habit and habitat , and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo 4-stage metamorphosis ( see holometabolism ) . insects that undergo 3-stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages . the higher level relationship of the hexapoda is unclear . fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the paleozoic era , including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm ( 22–28 in ) . the most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants .
on the origin of species was first published on thursday 24 november 1859 , priced at fifteen shillings with a first printing of 1250 copies . the book had been offered to booksellers at murray 's autumn sale on tuesday 22 november , and all available copies had been taken up immediately . in total , 1,250 copies were printed but after deducting presentation and review copies , and five for stationers ' hall copyright , around 1,170 copies were available for sale . significantly , 500 were taken by mudie 's library , ensuring that the book promptly reached a large number of subscribers to the library . the second edition of 3,000 copies was quickly brought out on 7 january 1860 , and incorporated numerous corrections as well as a response to religious objections by the addition of a new epigraph on page ii , a quotation from charles kingsley , and the phrase " by the creator " added to the closing sentence . during darwin 's lifetime the book went through six editions , with cumulative changes and revisions to deal with counter-arguments raised . the third edition came out in 1861 , with a number of sentences rewritten or added and an introductory appendix , an historical sketch of the recent progress of opinion on the origin of species , while the fourth in 1866 had further revisions . the fifth edition , published on 10 february 1869 , incorporated more changes and for the first time included the phrase " survival of the fittest " , which had been coined by the philosopher herbert spencer in his principles of biology ( 1864 ) .
the tourist industry is heavily based on the promotion of napoleon 's imprisonment . a golf course also exists and the possibility for sportfishing tourism is great . three hotels operate on the island but the arrival of tourists is directly linked to the arrival and departure schedule of the rms st helena . some 3,200 short-term visitors arrived on the island in 2013 .
symbiotic relationships include those associations in which one organism lives on another ( ectosymbiosis , such as mistletoe ) , or where one partner lives inside the other ( endosymbiosis , such as lactobacilli and other bacteria in humans or symbiodinium in corals ) . symbiosis is also classified by physical attachment of the organisms ; symbiosis in which the organisms have bodily union is called conjunctive symbiosis , and symbiosis in which they are not in union is called disjunctive symbiosis .
the annual united states open tennis championships is one of the world 's four grand slam tennis tournaments and is held at the national tennis center in flushing meadows-corona park , queens . the new york marathon is one of the world 's largest , and the 2004–2006 events hold the top three places in the marathons with the largest number of finishers , including 37,866 finishers in 2006 . the millrose games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the wanamaker mile . boxing is also a prominent part of the city 's sporting scene , with events like the amateur boxing golden gloves being held at madison square garden each year . the city is also considered the host of the belmont stakes , the last , longest and oldest of horse racing 's triple crown races , held just over the city 's border at belmont park on the first or second sunday of june . the city also hosted the 1932 u.s. open golf tournament and the 1930 and 1939 pga championships , and has been host city for both events several times , most notably for nearby winged foot golf club .
the gastronomic symbol of the région is undoubtedly the choucroute , a local variety of sauerkraut . the word sauerkraut in alsatian has the form sûrkrût , same as in other southwestern german dialects , and means " sour cabbage " as its standard german equivalent . this word was included into the french language as choucroute . to make it , the cabbage is finely shredded , layered with salt and juniper and left to ferment in wooden barrels . sauerkraut can be served with poultry , pork , sausage or even fish . traditionally it is served with strasbourg sausage or frankfurters , bacon , smoked pork or smoked morteau or montbéliard sausages , or a selection of other pork products . served alongside are often roasted or steamed potatoes or dumplings .
early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period , primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases . in 1885 louis pasteur and pierre paul émile roux created the first rabies vaccine . the first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin ( produced from the serum of an inoculated animal ) , but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used . the united states recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths . in 1923 parallel efforts by gaston ramon at the pasteur institute and alexander glenny at the wellcome research laboratories ( later part of glaxosmithkline ) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde . in 1944 , maurice hilleman of squibb pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against japanese encephelitis . hilleman would later move to merck where he would play a key role in the development of vaccines against measles , mumps , chickenpox , rubella , hepatitis a , hepatitis b , and meningitis .
on 3 november 2007 , the sichuan transportation bureau announced that the sui-yu expressway was completed after three years of construction . after completion of the chongqing section of the road , the 36.64 km ( 22.77 mi ) expressway connected cheng-nan expressway and formed the shortest expressway from chengdu to chongqing . the new expressway is 50 km ( 31 mi ) shorter than the pre-existing road between chengdu and chongqing ; thus journey time between the two cities was reduced by an hour , now taking two and a half hours . the sui-yu expressway is a four lane overpass with a speed limit of 80 km/h ( 50 mph ) . the total investment was 1.045 billion yuan .
" old style " ( os ) and " new style " ( ns ) are sometimes added to dates to identify which system is used in the british empire and other countries that did not immediately change . because the calendar act of 1750 altered the start of the year , and also aligned the british calendar with the gregorian calendar , there is some confusion as to what these terms mean . they can indicate that the start of the julian year has been adjusted to start on 1 january ( ns ) even though contemporary documents use a different start of year ( os ) ; or to indicate that a date conforms to the julian calendar ( os ) , formerly in use in many countries , rather than the gregorian calendar ( ns ) .
the migration-period peoples who later coalesced into a " german " ethnicity were the germanic tribes of the saxons , franci , thuringii , alamanni and bavarii . these five tribes , sometimes with inclusion of the frisians , are considered as the major groups to take part in the formation of the germans . the varieties of the german language are still divided up into these groups . linguists distinguish low saxon , franconian , bavarian , thuringian and alemannic varieties in modern german . by the 9th century , the large tribes which lived on the territory of modern germany had been united under the rule of the frankish king charlemagne , known in german as karl der große . much of what is now eastern germany became slavonic-speaking ( sorbs and veleti ) , after these areas were vacated by germanic tribes ( vandals , lombards , burgundians and suebi amongst others ) which had migrated into the former areas of the roman empire .
in mid may 1967 , the soviet union issued warnings to nasser of an impending israeli attack on syria . although the chief of staff mohamed fawzi verified them as " baseless " , nasser took three successive steps that made the war virtually inevitable : on 14 may he deployed his troops in sinai near the border with israel , on 19 may he expelled the un peacekeepers stationed in the sinai peninsula border with israel , and on 23 may he closed the straits of tiran to israeli shipping . on 26 may nasser declared , " the battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy israel " .
in china , yellow emperor is regarded as the humanistic primogenitor . [ citation needed ] sage kings such as yao and shun are humanistic figures as recorded . [ citation needed ] king wu of zhou has the famous saying : " humanity is the ling ( efficacious essence ) of the world ( among all ) . " among them duke of zhou , respected as a founder of rujia ( confucianism ) , is especially prominent and pioneering in humanistic thought . his words were recorded in the book of history as follows ( translation ) : [ citation needed ]
in 2003 , harding earley follmer & frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the archive 's wayback machine . the attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid , based on the content of their web site from several years prior . the plaintiff , healthcare advocates , then amended their complaint to include the internet archive , accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the dmca and the computer fraud and abuse act . healthcare advocates claimed that , since they had installed a robots.txt file on their web site , even if after the initial lawsuit was filed , the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff web site from the wayback machine . the lawsuit was settled out of court .
the loss of eight battleships and 2,403 americans at pearl harbor forced the u.s. to rely on its remaining aircraft carriers , which won a major victory over japan at midway just six months into the war , and on its growing submarine fleet . the navy and marine corps followed this up with an island hopping campaign across the central and south pacific in 1943–45 , reaching the outskirts of japan in the battle of okinawa . during 1942 and 1943 , the u.s. deployed millions of men and thousands of planes and tanks to the uk , beginning with the strategic bombing of nazi germany and occupied europe and leading up to the allied invasions of occupied north africa in november 1942 , sicily and italy in 1943 , france in 1944 , and the invasion of germany in 1945 , parallel with the soviet invasion from the east . that led to the surrender of nazi germany in may 1945 . in the pacific , the u.s. experienced much success in naval campaigns during 1944 , but bloody battles at iwo jima and okinawa in 1945 led the u.s. to look for a way to end the war with minimal loss of american lives . the u.s. used atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki to destroy the japanese war effort and to shock the japanese leadership , which quickly caused the surrender of japan .
the word " paper " is etymologically derived from latin papyrus , which comes from the greek πάπυρος ( papuros ) , the word for the cyperus papyrus plant . papyrus is a thick , paper-like material produced from the pith of the cyperus papyrus plant , which was used in ancient egypt and other mediterranean cultures for writing before the introduction of paper into the middle east and europe . although the word paper is etymologically derived from papyrus , the two are produced very differently and the development of the first is distinct from the development of the second . papyrus is a lamination of natural plant fibres , while paper is manufactured from fibres whose properties have been changed by maceration .
bohr also introduced the quantity , now known as the reduced planck constant , as the quantum of angular momentum . at first , bohr thought that this was the angular momentum of each electron in an atom : this proved incorrect and , despite developments by sommerfeld and others , an accurate description of the electron angular momentum proved beyond the bohr model . the correct quantization rules for electrons – in which the energy reduces to the bohr model equation in the case of the hydrogen atom – were given by heisenberg 's matrix mechanics in 1925 and the schrödinger wave equation in 1926 : the reduced planck constant remains the fundamental quantum of angular momentum . in modern terms , if j is the total angular momentum of a system with rotational invariance , and jz the angular momentum measured along any given direction , these quantities can only take on the values
although the arenafootball2 league played its tenth season in 2009 , a conference call in december 2008 resulted in enough votes from owners and cooperation from the aflpa for the afl to suspend the entire 2009 season in order to create " a long-term plan to improve its economic model " . in doing so , the afl became the second sports league to cancel an entire season , after the national hockey league cancelled the 2004-05 season because of a lockout . the afl also became the third sports league to lose its postseason ( the first being major league baseball , which lost its postseason in 1994 because of a strike ) . efforts to reformat the league 's business model were placed under the leadership of columbus destroyers owner jim renacci and interim commissioner policy .

kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955 . a large number of restaurants in kathmandu have since opened , catering nepali cuisine , tibetan cuisine , chinese cuisine and indian cuisine in particular . many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals , expatriates , and tourists . the growth of tourism in kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as american chop suey , which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine . continental cuisine can be found in selected places . international chain restaurants are rare , but some outlets of pizza hut and kfc have recently opened there . it also has several outlets of the international ice-cream chain baskin-robbins
the most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus , bacteria , or parasite ; a condition known as gastroenteritis . these infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool , or directly from another person who is infected . it may be divided into three types : short duration watery diarrhea , short duration bloody diarrhea , and if it lasts for more than two weeks , persistent diarrhea . the short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by cholera , although this is rare in the developed world . if blood is present it is also known as dysentery . a number of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea , including hyperthyroidism , lactose intolerance , inflammatory bowel disease , a number of medications , and irritable bowel syndrome . in most cases , stool cultures are not required to confirm the exact cause .
von neumann continued unperturbed in his work and became , along with edward teller , one of those who sustained the hydrogen bomb project . he then collaborated with klaus fuchs on further development of the bomb , and in 1946 the two filed a secret patent on " improvement in methods and means for utilizing nuclear energy " , which outlined a scheme for using a fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to initiate nuclear fusion . the fuchs–von neumann patent used radiation implosion , but not in the same way as is used in what became the final hydrogen bomb design , the teller–ulam design . their work was , however , incorporated into the " george " shot of operation greenhouse , which was instructive in testing out concepts that went into the final design . the fuchs–von neumann work was passed on , by fuchs , to the soviet union as part of his nuclear espionage , but it was not used in the soviets ' own , independent development of the teller–ulam design . the historian jeremy bernstein has pointed out that ironically , " john von neumann and klaus fuchs , produced a brilliant invention in 1946 that could have changed the whole course of the development of the hydrogen bomb , but was not fully understood until after the bomb had been successfully made . "
beer is composed mostly of water . regions have water with different mineral components ; as a result , different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer , thus giving them a regional character . for example , dublin has hard water well-suited to making stout , such as guinness ; while the plzeň region has soft water well-suited to making pilsner ( pale lager ) , such as pilsner urquell . the waters of burton in england contain gypsum , which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as burtonisation .
theories dealing with perception either use one or multiples perceptions in order to find an emotion ( goldie , 2007 ) .a recent hybrid of the somatic and cognitive theories of emotion is the perceptual theory . this theory is neo-jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions , yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something , as is recognized by cognitive theories . the novel claim of this theory is that conceptually-based cognition is unnecessary for such meaning . rather the bodily changes themselves perceive the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations . in this respect , emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch , which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways . a sophisticated defense of this view is found in philosopher jesse prinz 's book gut reactions , and psychologist james laird 's book feelings .
brooke foss westcott ( 1825–1901 ) and fenton j . a. hort ( 1828–1892 ) published an edition of the new testament in greek in 1881 . they proposed nine critical rules , including a version of bengel 's rule , " the reading is less likely to be original that shows a disposition to smooth away difficulties . " they also argued that " readings are approved or rejected by reason of the quality , and not the number , of their supporting witnesses " , and that " the reading is to be preferred that most fitly explains the existence of the others . "
windows 8 was released to a mixed critical reception . although reaction towards its performance improvements , security enhancements , and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive , the new user interface of the operating system was widely criticized for being potentially confusing and difficult to learn ( especially when used with a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen ) . despite these shortcomings , 60 million windows 8 licenses have been sold through january 2013 , a number which included both upgrades and sales to oems for new pcs .
in 2001 , she became the first african-american woman and second woman songwriter to win the pop songwriter of the year award at the american society of composers , authors , and publishers pop music awards . beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs ( " irreplaceable " , " grillz " and " check on it " ) in the same year , after carole king in 1971 and mariah carey in 1991 . she is tied with american songwriter diane warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles . ( the latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song " i was here " for 4 . ) in may 2011 , billboard magazine listed beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the " top 20 hot 100 songwriters " , for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the billboard hot 100 chart . she was one of only three women on that list .
after the 1980s , the use of the " canadian armed forces " name gave way to " canadian forces " ; [ citation needed ] the " canadian armed forces " name returned in 2013 .
as there is no research indicating which of the three components is essential in defining sexual orientation , all three are used independently and provide different conclusions regarding sexual orientation . savin williams ( 2006 ) discusses this issue and notes that by basing findings regarding sexual orientation on a single component , researchers may not actually capture the intended population . for example , if homosexual is defined by same sex behavior , gay virgins are omitted , heterosexuals engaging in same sex behavior for other reasons than preferred sexual arousal are miscounted , and those with same sex attraction who only have opposite-sex relations are excluded . because of the limited populations that each component captures , consumers of research should be cautious in generalizing these findings .
following the success of le journal de mickey ( 1934–44 ) , dedicated comics magazines and full-colour comics albums became the primary outlet for comics in the mid-20th century . as in the us , at the time comics were seen as infantile and a threat to culture and literacy ; commentators stated that " none bear up to the slightest serious analysis " , [ c ] and that comics were " the sabotage of all art and all literature " .

the very large and ornate school hall and school library ( by l k. hall ) were erected in 1906-8 across the road from upper school as the school 's memorial to the etonians who had died in the boer war . many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead etonians of the great war . a bomb destroyed part of upper school in world war two and blew out many windows in the chapel . the college commissioned replacements by evie hone ( 1949–52 ) and by john piper and patrick reyntiens ( 1959 onwards ) .
jan joosten van lodensteijn ( 1556 ? –1623 ? ) , a dutch colleague of adams ' on their ill-fated voyage to japan in the ship de liefde , was also given similar privileges by tokugawa ieyasu . it appears joosten became a samurai [ citation needed ] and was given a residence within ieyasu 's castle at edo . today , this area at the east exit of tokyo station is known as yaesu ( 八重洲 ) . yaesu is a corruption of the dutchman 's japanese name , yayousu ( 耶楊子 ) . also in common with adam 's , joostens was given a red seal ship ( 朱印船 ) allowing him to trade between japan and indo-china . on a return journey from batavia joosten drowned after his ship ran aground .
one catobar carrier : são paulo is a clemenceau-class aircraft carrier currently in service with the brazilian navy . são paulo was first commissioned in 1963 by the french navy as foch and was transferred in 2000 to brazil , where she became the new flagship of the brazilian navy . during the period from 2005–2010 , são paulo underwent extensive modernization . at the end of 2010 , sea trials began , and as of 2011 [ update ] são paulo had been evaluated by the ciasa ( inspection commission and training advisory ) . she was expected to rejoin the fleet in late 2013 , but suffered another major fire in 2012 .

proto-slavic , sometimes referred to as common slavic or late proto-slavic , is defined as the last stage of the language preceding the geographical split of the historical slavic languages . that language was uniform , and on the basis of borrowings from foreign languages and slavic borrowings into other languages , can not be said to have any recognizable dialects , suggesting a comparatively compact homeland . slavic linguistic unity was to some extent visible as late as old church slavonic manuscripts which , though based on local slavic speech of thessaloniki , could still serve the purpose of the first common slavic literary language .
most migrations begin with the birds starting off in a broad front . often , this front narrows into one or more preferred routes termed flyways . these routes typically follow mountain ranges or coastlines , sometimes rivers , and may take advantage of updrafts and other wind patterns or avoid geographical barriers such as large stretches of open water . the specific routes may be genetically programmed or learned to varying degrees . the routes taken on forward and return migration are often different . a common pattern in north america is clockwise migration , where birds flying north tend to be further west , and flying south tend to shift eastwards .
in march 1949 , as rca released the 45 , columbia released several hundred 7 inch 33 1/3 rpm small spindle hole singles . this format was soon dropped as it became clear that the rca 45 was the single of choice and the columbia 12 inch lp would be the 'album ' of choice . the first release of the 45 came in seven colors : black 47-xxxx popular series , yellow 47-xxxx juvenile series , green ( teal ) 48-xxxx country series , deep red 49-xxxx classical series , bright red ( cerise ) 50-xxxx blues/spiritual series , light blue 51-xxxx international series , dark blue 52-xxxx light classics . all colors were soon dropped in favor of black because of production problems . however , yellow and deep red were continued until about 1952 . the first 45 rpm record created for sale was " peewee the piccolo " rca 47-0147 pressed in yellow translucent vinyl at the sherman avenue plant , indianapolis dec. 7 , 1948 , r.o . price , plant manager .
after the fall of napoleon , not only was napoleonic code retained by conquered countries including the netherlands , belgium , parts of italy and germany , but has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside europe including the dominican republic , the us state of louisiana and the canadian province of quebec . the memory of napoleon in poland is favorable , for his support for independence and opposition to russia , his legal code , the abolition of serfdom , and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies .
the pulp papermaking process is said to have been developed in china during the early 2nd century ad , possibly as early as the year 105 a.d. , by the han court eunuch cai lun , although the earliest archaeological fragments of paper derive from the 2nd century bc in china . the modern pulp and paper industry is global , with china leading its production and the united states right behind it .
various cases for rape , physical abuse and murder were prosecuted in court . women , although usually having fewer rights by custom , were allowed to level civil and criminal charges against men . while suspects were jailed , convicted criminals were never imprisoned . instead , punishments were commonly monetary fines , periods of forced hard labor for convicts , and the penalty of death by beheading . early han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from qin law . a series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado .
records of bird migration were made as much as 3,000 years ago by the ancient greek writers hesiod , homer , herodotus and aristotle . the bible also notes migrations , as in the book of job ( 39:26 ) , where the inquiry is made : " is it by your insight that the hawk hovers , spreads its wings southward ? " the author of jeremiah ( 8:7 ) wrote : " even the stork in the heavens knows its seasons , and the turtle dove , the swift and the crane keep the time of their arrival . "
the british empire comprised the dominions , colonies , protectorates , mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the united kingdom . it originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by england between the late 16th and early 18th centuries . at its height , it was the largest empire in history and , for over a century , was the foremost global power . by 1922 the british empire held sway over about 458 million people , one-fifth of the world 's population at the time , and covered more than 13,000,000 sq mi ( 33,670,000 km2 ) , almost a quarter of the earth 's total land area . as a result , its political , legal , linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread . at the peak of its power , the phrase " the empire on which the sun never sets " was often used to describe the british empire , because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories .
ptolemy 's family ruled egypt until the roman conquest of 30 bc . all the male rulers of the dynasty took the name ptolemy . ptolemaic queens , some of whom were the sisters of their husbands , were usually called cleopatra , arsinoe or berenice . the most famous member of the line was the last queen , cleopatra vii , known for her role in the roman political battles between julius caesar and pompey , and later between octavian and mark antony . her suicide at the conquest by rome marked the end of ptolemaic rule in egypt though hellenistic culture continued to thrive in egypt throughout the roman and byzantine periods until the muslim conquest .
carnivore was an electronic eavesdropping software system implemented by the fbi during the clinton administration ; it was designed to monitor email and electronic communications . after prolonged negative coverage in the press , the fbi changed the name of its system from " carnivore " to " dcs1000 . " dcs is reported to stand for " digital collection system " ; the system has the same functions as before . the associated press reported in mid-january 2005 that the fbi essentially abandoned the use of carnivore in 2001 , in favor of commercially available software , such as narusinsight .
barcelona is one of three founding members of the primera división that have never been relegated from the top division , along with athletic bilbao and real madrid . in 2009 , barcelona became the first spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of la liga , copa del rey , and the uefa champions league , and also became the first football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year , completing the sextuple in also winning the spanish super cup , uefa super cup and fifa club world cup . in 2011 , the club became european champions again and won five trophies . this barcelona team , which reached a record six consecutive champions league semi-finals and won 14 trophies in just four years under pep guardiola , is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time . in june 2015 , barcelona became the first european club in history to achieve the continental treble twice .
the photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons ( called " photoelectrons " ) from a surface when light is shone on it . it was first observed by alexandre edmond becquerel in 1839 , although credit is usually reserved for heinrich hertz , who published the first thorough investigation in 1887 . another particularly thorough investigation was published by philipp lenard in 1902 . einstein 's 1905 paper discussing the effect in terms of light quanta would earn him the nobel prize in 1921 , when his predictions had been confirmed by the experimental work of robert andrews millikan . the nobel committee awarded the prize for his work on the photo-electric effect , rather than relativity , both because of a bias against purely theoretical physics not grounded in discovery or experiment , and dissent amongst its members as to the actual proof that relativity was real .
the lutherans were the first protestant church offering a dialogue to the catholic church in september 1964 in reykjavík , iceland . it resulted in joint study groups of several issues . the dialogue with the methodist church began october 1965 , after its representatives officially applauded remarkable changes , friendship and cooperation of the past five years . the reformed churches entered four years later into a dialogue with the catholic church . the president of the lutheran world federation and member of the central committee of the world council of churches fredrik a. schiotz stated during the 450th anniversary of the reformation , that earlier commemorations were viewed almost as a triumph . reformation should be celebrated as a thanksgiving to god , his truth and his renewed life . he welcomed the announcement of pope paul vi to celebrate the 1900th anniversary of the death of the apostle peter and apostle paul , and promised the participation and cooperation in the festivities .
in the united kingdom , it has been alleged that peerages have been awarded to contributors to party funds , the benefactors becoming members of the house of lords and thus being in a position to participate in legislating . famously , lloyd george was found to have been selling peerages . to prevent such corruption in the future , parliament passed the honours ( prevention of abuses ) act 1925 into law . thus the outright sale of peerages and similar honours became a criminal act . however , some benefactors are alleged to have attempted to circumvent this by cloaking their contributions as loans , giving rise to the 'cash for peerages ' scandal .
however questions still remain , as some of the corrupt government officials have still not been brought to justice , while the many families who lost their only child , are still seeking compensation and justice to what had happened . according to the times , many parents were warned by the government not to stage a protest under the threat of arrest .
greece participated in the eurovision song contest 35 times after its debut at the 1974 contest . in 2005 , greece won with the song " my number one " , performed by greek-swedish singer elena paparizou . the song received 230 points with 10 sets of 12 points from belgium , bulgaria , hungary , the united kingdom , turkey , albania , cyprus , serbia & montenegro , sweden and germany and also became a smash hit in different countries and especially in greece . the 51st eurovision song contest was held in athens at the olympic indoor hall of the athens olympic sports complex in maroussi , with hosted by maria menounos and sakis rouvas .
while the majority of flowers are perfect or hermaphrodite ( having both pollen and ovule producing parts in the same flower structure ) , flowering plants have developed numerous morphological and physiological mechanisms to reduce or prevent self-fertilization . heteromorphic flowers have short carpels and long stamens , or vice versa , so animal pollinators can not easily transfer pollen to the pistil ( receptive part of the carpel ) . homomorphic flowers may employ a biochemical ( physiological ) mechanism called self-incompatibility to discriminate between self and non-self pollen grains . in other species , the male and female parts are morphologically separated , developing on different flowers .
some common epithets of apollo as a healer are " paion " ( παιών , literally " healer " or " helper " ) " epikourios " ( ἐπικουρώ , " help " ) , " oulios " ( οὐλή , " healed wound " , also a " scar " ) and " loimios " ( λοιμός , " plague " ) . in classical times , his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil , and was therefore called " apotropaios " ( ἀποτρέπω , " divert " , " deter " , " avert " ) and " alexikakos " ( from v. ἀλέξω + n. κακόν , " defend from evil " ) . in later writers , the word , usually spelled " paean " , becomes a mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as a god of healing .
bell 's father was invited by sarah fuller , principal of the boston school for deaf mutes ( which continues today as the public horace mann school for the deaf ) , in boston , massachusetts , to introduce the visible speech system by providing training for fuller 's instructors , but he declined the post in favor of his son . traveling to boston in april 1871 , bell proved successful in training the school 's instructors . he was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the american asylum for deaf-mutes in hartford , connecticut , and the clarke school for the deaf in northampton , massachusetts .
in 1937 , nasser applied to the royal military academy for army officer training , but his police record of anti-government protest initially blocked his entry . disappointed , he enrolled in the law school at king fuad university , but quit after one semester to reapply to the military academy . from his readings , nasser , who frequently spoke of " dignity , glory , and freedom " in his youth , became enchanted with the stories of national liberators and heroic conquerors ; a military career became his chief priority .
starting in 1984 , some of these djs , inspired by jesse saunders ' success with " on and on " , tried their hand at producing and releasing original compositions . these compositions used newly affordable electronic instruments to emulate not just saunders ' song , but the edited , enhanced styles of disco and other dance music they already favored . these homegrown productions were played on chicago-area radio and in local discothèques catering mainly to african-american and gay audiences . by 1985 , although the exact origins of the term are debated , " house music " encompassed these locally produced recordings . subgenres of house , including deep house and acid house , quickly emerged and gained traction .
in contrast with other romance languages , catalan has many monosyllabic words ; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters . also , catalan has final obstruent devoicing , thus featuring many couplets like amic " ( male friend " ) vs. amiga ( " female friend " ) .
the use of the term middle east as a region of international affairs apparently began in british and american diplomatic circles quite independently of each other over concern for the security of the same country : iran , then known to the west as persia . in 1900 thomas edward gordon published an article , the problem of the middle east , which began :
while mont blanc was first climbed in 1786 , most of the alpine four-thousanders were climbed during the first half of the 19th century ; the ascent of the matterhorn in 1865 marked the end of the golden age of alpinism . karl blodig ( 1859–1956 ) was among the first to successfully climb all the major 4,000 m peaks . he completed his series of ascents in 1911 .
on 28 january 1871 the government of national defence based in paris negotiated an armistice with the prussians . with paris starving , and gambetta 's provincial armies reeling from one disaster after another , french foreign minister favre went to versailles on 24 january to discuss peace terms with bismarck . bismarck agreed to end the siege and allow food convoys to immediately enter paris ( including trains carrying millions of german army rations ) , on condition that the government of national defence surrender several key fortresses outside paris to the prussians . without the forts , the french army would no longer be able to defend paris .
several influential people of the time , including bell , viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated , and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language , thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded . in several schools , children were mistreated , for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing—the only language they knew—in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication . owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language , bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing deaf culture .
in ancient times , greece was the birthplace of western culture . modern democracies owe a debt to greek beliefs in government by the people , trial by jury , and equality under the law . the ancient greeks pioneered in many fields that rely on systematic thought , including biology , geometry , history , philosophy , physics and mathematics . they introduced such important literary forms as epic and lyric poetry , history , tragedy , and comedy . in their pursuit of order and proportion , the greeks created an ideal of beauty that strongly influenced western art .
the use of such contractions is as old as chinese characters themselves , and they have frequently been found in religious or ritual use . in the oracle bone script , personal names , ritual items , and even phrases such as 受又 ( 祐 ) shòu yòu " receive blessings " are commonly contracted into single characters . a dramatic example is that in medieval manuscripts 菩薩 púsà " bodhisattva " ( simplified : 菩萨 ) is sometimes written with a single character formed of a 2×2 grid of four 十 ( derived from the grass radical over two 十 ) . however , for the sake of consistency and standardization , the cpc seeks to limit the use of such polysyllabic characters in public writing to ensure that every character only has one syllable .
judging relationships based on shared characters requires care , since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently . some euphorbias have leafless , rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti , but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related . the cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters , distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups ( homoplasies ) or those left over from ancestors ( plesiomorphies ) – and derived characters , which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor ( apomorphies ) . only derived characters , such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti , provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor . the results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms : tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent .
a similar fate befell the curonians who lived in the area around the curonian lagoon . while many fled from the red army during the evacuation of east prussia , curonians that remained behind were subsequently expelled by the soviet union . only 219 lived along the curonian spit in 1955 . many had german names such as fritz or hans , a cause for anti-german discrimination . the soviet authorities considered the curonians fascists . because of this discrimination , many immigrated to west germany in 1958 , where the majority of curonians now live .
when a usb device is first connected to a usb host , the usb device enumeration process is started . the enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the usb device . the data rate of the usb device is determined during the reset signaling . after reset , the usb device 's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address . if the device is supported by the host , the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state . if the usb host is restarted , the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices .
one of the most complex characters found in modern chinese dictionaries [ g ] is 齉 ( u+9f49 ) ( nàng , listen ( help·info ) , pictured below , middle image ) , meaning " snuffle " ( that is , a pronunciation marred by a blocked nose ) , with " just " thirty-six strokes . however , this is not in common use . the most complex character that can be input using the microsoft new phonetic ime 2002a for traditional chinese is 龘 ( dá , " the appearance of a dragon flying " ) . it is composed of the dragon radical represented three times , for a total of 16 × 3 = 48 strokes . among the most complex characters in modern dictionaries and also in frequent modern use are 籲 ( yù , " to implore " ) , with 32 strokes ; 鬱 ( yù , " luxuriant , lush ; gloomy " ) , with 29 strokes , as in 憂鬱 ( yōuyù , " depressed " ) ; 豔 ( yàn , " colorful " ) , with 28 strokes ; and 釁 ( xìn , " quarrel " ) , with 25 strokes , as in 挑釁 ( tiǎoxìn , " to pick a fight " ) . also in occasional modern use is 鱻 ( xiān " fresh " ; variant of 鮮 xiān ) with 33 strokes .
gamal abdel nasser hussein ( arabic : جمال عبد الناصر حسين‎ , ipa : [ ɡæˈmæːl ʕæbdenˈnɑːsˤeɾ ħeˈseːn ] ; 15 january 1918 – 28 september 1970 ) was the second president of egypt , serving from 1956 until his death . nasser led the 1952 overthrow of the monarchy and introduced far-reaching land reforms the following year . following a 1954 attempt on his life by a muslim brotherhood member acting on his own , he cracked down on the organization , put president muhammad naguib under house arrest , and assumed executive office , officially becoming president in june 1956 .
new haven lies in the transition between a humid continental climate ( köppen climate classification : dfa ) and humid subtropical climate ( köppen cfa ) , but having more characteristics of the former , as is typical of much of the new york metropolitan area . summers are humid and warm , with temperatures exceeding 90 °f ( 32 °c ) on 7–8 days per year . winters are cold with moderate snowfall interspersed with rainfall and occasionally mixed precipitation . the weather patterns that affect new haven result from a primarily offshore direction , thus reducing the marine influence of long island sound—although , like other marine areas , differences in temperature between areas right along the coastline and areas a mile or two inland can be large at times .
based on the strength of his work , universal signed spielberg to do four tv films . the first was a richard matheson adaptation called duel . the film is about a psychotic peterbilt 281 tanker truck driver who chases the terrified driver ( dennis weaver ) of a small plymouth valiant and tries to run him off the road . special praise of this film by the influential british critic dilys powell was highly significant to spielberg 's career . another tv film ( something evil ) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of the exorcist , then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film . he fulfilled his contract by directing the tv film-length pilot of a show called savage , starring martin landau . spielberg 's debut full-length feature film was the sugarland express , about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby . spielberg 's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers , and the hollywood reporter stated that " a major new director is on the horizon . " :223 however , the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release .
the blue ridge mountains , rising in southern pennsylvania and there known as south mountain , attain elevations of about 2,000 ft ( 600 m ) in that state . south mountain achieves its highest point just below the mason-dixon line in maryland at quirauk mountain 2,145 ft ( 654 m ) and then diminishes in height southward to the potomac river . once in virginia the blue ridge again reaches 2,000 ft ( 600 m ) and higher . in the virginia blue ridge , the following are some of the highest peaks north of the roanoke river : stony man 4,031 ft ( 1,229 m ) , hawksbill mountain 4,066 ft ( 1,239 m ) , apple orchard mountain 4,225 ft ( 1,288 m ) and peaks of otter 4,001 and 3,875 ft ( 1,220 and 1,181 m ) . south of the roanoke river , along the blue ridge , are virginia 's highest peaks including whitetop mountain 5,520 ft ( 1,680 m ) and mount rogers 5,729 ft ( 1,746 m ) , the highest point in the commonwealth .
in an attempt at reform , eritrean government officials and ngo representatives have participated in numerous public meetings and dialogues . in these sessions they have answered questions as fundamental as , " what are human rights ? " , " who determines what are human rights ? " , and " what should take precedence , human or communal rights ? " in 2007 , the eritrean government also banned female genital mutilation . in regional assemblies and religious circles , eritreans themselves speak out continuously against the use of female circumcision . they cite health concerns and individual freedom as being of primary concern when they say this . furthermore , they implore rural peoples to cast away this ancient cultural practice . additionally , a new movement called citizens for democratic rights in eritrea aimed at bringing about dialogue between the government and opposition was formed in early 2009 . the group consists of ordinary citizens and some people close to the government .
to the north-east of the somerset levels , the mendip hills are moderately high limestone hills . the central and western mendip hills was designated an area of outstanding natural beauty in 1972 and covers 198 km2 ( 76 sq mi ) . the main habitat on these hills is calcareous grassland , with some arable agriculture . to the south-west of the somerset levels are the quantock hills which was england 's first area of outstanding natural beauty designated in 1956 which is covered in heathland , oak woodlands , ancient parklands with plantations of conifer and covers 99 square kilometres . the somerset coalfield is part of a larger coalfield which stretches into gloucestershire . to the north of the mendip hills is the chew valley and to the south , on the clay substrate , are broad valleys which support dairy farming and drain into the somerset levels .
russia , as a member of the holy alliance , had operated as the " police of europe " , maintaining the balance of power that had been established in the treaty of vienna in 1815 . russia had assisted austria 's efforts in suppressing the hungarian revolution of 1848 , and expected gratitude ; it wanted a free hand in settling its problems with the ottoman empire — the " sick man of europe " . the united kingdom could not tolerate russian dominance of ottoman affairs , as that would challenge the british domination of the eastern mediterranean .
beyoncé and husband jay z are friends with president barack obama and first lady michelle obama . she performed " america the beautiful " at the 2009 presidential inauguration , as well as " at last " during the first inaugural dance at the neighborhood ball two days later . beyoncé and jay z held a fundraiser at the latter 's 40/40 club in manhattan for obama 's 2012 presidential campaign which raised $ 4 million . beyoncé uploaded pictures of her paper ballot on tumblr , confirming she had voted in support for the democratic party and to encourage others to do so . she also performed the american national anthem at his second inauguration , singing along with a pre-recorded track . she publicly endorsed same sex marriage on march 26 , 2013 , after the supreme court debate on california 's proposition 8 . in july 2013 , beyoncé and jay-z attended a rally in response to the acquittal of george zimmerman for the shooting of trayvon martin .
according to john everett-heath , the author of oxford concise dictionary of world place names , hyderabad means " haydar 's city " or " lion city " , from haydar ( lion ) and ābād ( city ) . it was named to honour the caliph ali ibn abi talib , who was also known as haydar because of his lion-like valour in battles . andrew petersen , a scholar of islamic architecture , says the city was originally called baghnagar ( city of gardens ) . one popular theory suggests that muhammad quli qutb shah , the founder of the city , named it " bhagyanagar " or " bhāgnagar " after bhagmati , a local nautch ( dancing ) girl with whom he had fallen in love . she converted to islam and adopted the title hyder mahal . the city was renamed hyderabad in her honour . according to another source , the city was named after haidar , the son of quli qutb shah .
founded by dantidurga around 753 , the rashtrakuta empire ruled from its capital at manyakheta for almost two centuries . at its peak , the rashtrakutas ruled from the ganges river and yamuna river doab in the north to cape comorin in the south , a fruitful time of political expansion , architectural achievements and famous literary contributions . [ citation needed ] the early kings of this dynasty were hindu but the later kings were strongly influenced by jainism . govinda iii and amoghavarsha were the most famous of the long line of able administrators produced by the dynasty . amoghavarsha , who ruled for 64 years , was also an author and wrote kavirajamarga , the earliest known kannada work on poetics . architecture reached a milestone in the dravidian style , the finest example of which is seen in the kailasanath temple at ellora . other important contributions are the sculptures of elephanta caves in modern maharashtra as well as the kashivishvanatha temple and the jain narayana temple at pattadakal in modern karnataka , all of which are unesco world heritage sites . the arab traveler suleiman described the rashtrakuta empire as one of the four great empires of the world . the rashtrakuta period marked the beginning of the golden age of southern indian mathematics . the great south indian mathematician mahāvīra ( mathematician ) lived in the rashtrakuta empire and his text had a huge impact on the medieval south indian mathematicians who lived after him . the rashtrakuta rulers also patronised men of letters , who wrote in a variety of languages from sanskrit to the apabhraṃśas .
the simplest type of mp3 file uses one bit rate for the entire file : this is known as constant bit rate ( cbr ) encoding . using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and faster . however , it is also possible to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file . these are known as variable bit rate ( vbr ) files . the idea behind this is that , in any piece of audio , some parts will be much easier to compress , such as silence or music containing only a few instruments , while others will be more difficult to compress . so , the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts . with some encoders , it is possible to specify a given quality , and the encoder will vary the bit rate accordingly . users who know a particular " quality setting " that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music , and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate .
by total area ( water as well as land ) , the united states is either slightly larger or smaller than the people 's republic of china , making it the world 's third or fourth largest country . china and the united states are smaller than russia and canada in total area , but are larger than brazil . by land area only ( exclusive of waters ) , the united states is the world 's third largest country , after russia and china , with canada in fourth . whether the us or china is the third largest country by total area depends on two factors : ( 1 ) the validity of china 's claim on aksai chin and trans-karakoram tract . both these territories are also claimed by india , so are not counted ; and ( 2 ) how us calculates its own surface area . since the initial publishing of the world factbook , the cia has updated the total area of united states a number of times .
the key advantage of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current . this scheme was introduced because of the problems of return currents , intended to be carried by the earthed ( grounded ) running rail , flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead . this can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together . the problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains . some of these , particularly victorian mains that predated london 's underground railways , were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments . the four-rail system solves the problem . although the supply has an artificially created earth point , this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels . power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak , but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains . however , elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails .
portuguese cuisine is diverse . the portuguese consume a lot of dry cod ( bacalhau in portuguese ) , for which there are hundreds of recipes . there are more than enough bacalhau dishes for each day of the year . two other popular fish recipes are grilled sardines and caldeirada , a potato-based stew that can be made from several types of fish . typical portuguese meat recipes , that may be made out of beef , pork , lamb , or chicken , include cozido à portuguesa , feijoada , frango de churrasco , leitão ( roast suckling pig ) and carne de porco à alentejana . a very popular northern dish is the arroz de sarrabulho ( rice stewed in pigs blood ) or the arroz de cabidela ( rice and chickens meat stewed in chickens blood ) .
many flags of the islamic world are green , as the color is considered sacred in islam ( see below ) . the flag of hamas , as well as the flag of iran , is green , symbolizing their islamist ideology . the 1977 flag of libya consisted of a simple green field with no other characteristics . it was the only national flag in the world with just one color and no design , insignia , or other details . some countries used green in their flags to represent their country 's lush vegetation , as in the flag of jamaica , and hope in the future , as in the flags of portugal and nigeria . the green cedar of lebanon tree on the flag of lebanon officially represents steadiness and tolerance .
renaissance humanism was an activity of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors , book collectors , educators , and writers , who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as umanisti – " humanists " . it developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries , and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education , which was then dominated by aristotelian philosophy and logic . scholasticism focused on preparing men to be doctors , lawyers or professional theologians , and was taught from approved textbooks in logic , natural philosophy , medicine , law and theology . there were important centres of humanism at florence , naples , rome , venice , mantua , ferrara , and urbino .
the occupy wall street protests in zuccotti park in the financial district of lower manhattan began on september 17 , 2011 , receiving global attention and spawning the occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide .
the united kingdom has traditionally been governed as a unitary state by the westminster parliament in london . instead of adopting a federal model , the uk has relied on gradual devolution to decentralise political power . devolution in the uk began with the government of ireland act 1914 which granted home rule to ireland as a constituent country of the former united kingdom of great britain and ireland . following the partition of ireland in 1921 which saw the creation of the sovereign irish free state ( which eventually evolved into the modern day republic of ireland ) , northern ireland retained its devolved government through the parliament of northern ireland , the only part of the uk to have such a body at this time . this body was suspended in 1972 and northern ireland was governed by direct rule during the period of conflict known as the troubles .
later , the constitution was amended to state that the citizens of the 16 states had successfully achieved the unity of germany in free self-determination and that the basic law thus applied to the entire german people . article 23 , which had allowed " any other parts of germany " to join , was rephrased . it had been used in 1957 to reintegrate the saar protectorate as the saarland into the federal republic , and this was used as a model for german reunification in 1990 . the amended article now defines the participation of the federal council and the 16 german states in matters concerning the european union .
glass was used extensively during the middle ages . anglo-saxon glass has been found across england during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites . glass in the anglo-saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels , beads , windows and was also used in jewelry . from the 10th-century onwards , glass was employed in stained glass windows of churches and cathedrals , with famous examples at chartres cathedral and the basilica of saint denis . by the 14th-century , architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as sainte-chapelle , paris , ( 1203–1248 ) and the east end of gloucester cathedral . stained glass had a major revival with gothic revival architecture in the 19th-century . with the renaissance , and a change in architectural style , the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent . the use of domestic stained glass increased until most substantial houses had glass windows . these were initially small panes leaded together , but with the changes in technology , glass could be manufactured relatively cheaply in increasingly larger sheets . this led to larger window panes , and , in the 20th-century , to much larger windows in ordinary domestic and commercial buildings .
gamal abdel nasser was born on 15 january 1918 in bakos , alexandria , the first son of fahima and abdel nasser hussein . nasser 's father was a postal worker born in beni mur in upper egypt and raised in alexandria , and his mother 's family came from mallawi , el-minya . his parents married in 1917 , and later had two more boys , izz al-arab and al-leithi . nasser 's biographers robert stephens and said aburish wrote that nasser 's family believed strongly in the " arab notion of glory " , since the name of nasser 's brother , izz al-arab , translates to " glory of the arabs " —a rare name in egypt .
the scientific revolution was a period when european ideas in classical physics , astronomy , biology , human anatomy , chemistry , and other classical sciences were rejected and led to doctrines supplanting those that had prevailed from ancient greece to the middle ages which would lead to a transition to modern science . this period saw a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas across physics , astronomy , and biology , in institutions supporting scientific investigation , and in the more widely held picture of the universe . individuals started to question all manners of things and it was this questioning that led to the scientific revolution , which in turn formed the foundations of contemporary sciences and the establishment of several modern scientific fields .
on the morning of 11 september 2001 , 19 men affiliated with al-qaeda hijacked four airliners all bound for california . once the hijackers assumed control of the airliners , they told the passengers that they had the bomb on board and would spare the lives of passengers and crew once their demands were met – no passenger and crew actually suspected that they would use the airliners as suicide weapons since it had never happened before in history . the hijackers – members of al-qaeda 's hamburg cell – intentionally crashed two airliners into the twin towers of the world trade center in new york city . both buildings collapsed within two hours from fire damage related to the crashes , destroying nearby buildings and damaging others . the hijackers crashed a third airliner into the pentagon in arlington county , virginia , just outside washington d.c . the fourth plane crashed into a field near shanksville , pennsylvania , after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane , which the hijackers had redirected toward washington d.c. , to target the white house , or the u.s. capitol . no flights had survivors . a total of 2,977 victims and the 19 hijackers perished in the attacks .
universal music group decided not to renew their contract with the itunes store on july 3 , 2007 . universal will now supply itunes in an 'at will ' capacity .
in addition to re-writing the classification of annelids and 3 previously independent phyla , the molecular phylogenetics analyses undermine the emphasis that decades of previous writings placed on the importance of segmentation in the classification of invertebrates . polychaetes , which these analyses found to be the parent group , have completely segmented bodies , while polychaetes ' echiurans and sipunculan offshoots are not segmented and pogonophores are segmented only in the rear parts of their bodies . it now seems that segmentation can appear and disappear much more easily in the course of evolution than was previously thought . the 2007 study also noted that the ladder-like nervous system , which is associated with segmentation , is less universal previously thought in both annelids and arthropods . [ n 2 ]
conversely , most heat-treatable alloys are precipitation hardening alloys , which produce the opposite effects that steel does . when heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly , these alloys become much softer than normal , during the diffusionless transformation , and then harden as they age . the solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time , forming intermetallic phases , which are difficult to discern from the base metal . unlike steel , in which the solid solution separates to form different crystal phases , precipitation hardening alloys separate to form different phases within the same crystal . these intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure , but tend to behave heterogeneous , becoming hard and somewhat brittle .
major theaters in detroit include the fox theatre ( 5,174 seats ) , music hall ( 1,770 seats ) , the gem theatre ( 451 seats ) , masonic temple theatre ( 4,404 seats ) , the detroit opera house ( 2,765 seats ) , the fisher theatre ( 2,089 seats ) , the fillmore detroit ( 2,200 seats ) , saint andrew 's hall , the majestic theater , and orchestra hall ( 2,286 seats ) which hosts the renowned detroit symphony orchestra . the nederlander organization , the largest controller of broadway productions in new york city , originated with the purchase of the detroit opera house in 1922 by the nederlander family .
neptune 's mass of 1.0243×1026 kg , is intermediate between earth and the larger gas giants : it is 17 times that of earth but just 1/19th that of jupiter . [ d ] its gravity at 1 bar is 11.15 m/s2 , 1.14 times the surface gravity of earth , and surpassed only by jupiter . neptune 's equatorial radius of 24,764 km is nearly four times that of earth . neptune , like uranus , is an ice giant , a subclass of giant planet , due to their smaller size and higher concentrations of volatiles relative to jupiter and saturn . in the search for extrasolar planets , neptune has been used as a metonym : discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as " neptunes " , just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as " jupiters " .
rumors began swirling with regards to bringing the afl back to austin and san antonio , texas . both cities have hosted franchises in the past ( austin wranglers , san antonio force and san antonio talons ) , but an afl spokesman , bj pickard , was quoted as saying , " news to me . " announcements have yet to be made on any sort of expansion plans . an expected " big announcement " on friday , october 30 at a san antonio spurs game never came to fruition .
it has been revealed that southampton has the worst behaved secondary schools within the uk . with suspension rates three times the national average , the suspension rate is approximately 1 in every 14 children , the highest in the country for physical or verbal assaults against staff .
for its 2015 season , the league consisted of 12 teams , all from the united states ; however , upon the completion of the regular season , the league announced that the two teams it had assumed operation of during the season would cease all operations effective immediately ; a regular season game slated between the two had previously been canceled and declared a tie . subsequently , one of the remaining teams , the spokane shock , severed its ties with the league to join the competing ifl . the afl is divided into two conferences – the american conference and national conference . starting 2016 , each conference will have only four teams as the champion san jose sabercats announced in november 2015 that they were ceasing activity for " reasons not associated with league operations . "
the second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer harding lemay termed " the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white southerner in the treatment of the negro " . in the years following its release , many reviewers considered to kill a mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations . claudia durst johnson considers it " reasonable to believe " that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in alabama : rosa parks ' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person , which sparked the 1955 montgomery bus boycott , and the 1956 riots at the university of alabama after autherine lucy and polly myers were admitted ( myers eventually withdrew her application and lucy was expelled , but reinstated in 1980 ) . in writing about the historical context of the novel 's construction , two other literary scholars remark : " to kill a mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the south since the civil war and reconstruction . inevitably , despite its mid-1930s setting , the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts , tensions , and fears induced by this transition . "
in 1998 the angiosperm phylogeny group published a phylogeny for flowering plants based on an analysis of dna sequences from most families of flowering plants . as a result of this work , many questions , such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms , have now been answered . investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants . despite the study of model plants and increasing use of dna evidence , there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa . technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed .
the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus , especially the delta junction area , about 100 miles ( 160 km ) southeast of fairbanks , with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops ; these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely . this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor . delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay . west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants , the hotel and tourist industry , and community-supported agriculture .
the early cretaceous spans from 145 million to 100 million years ago . the early cretaceous saw the expansion of seaways , and as a result , the decline and extinction of sauropods ( except in south america ) . many coastal shallows were created , and that caused ichthyosaurs to die out . mosasaurs evolved to replace them as head of the seas . some island-hopping dinosaurs , like eustreptospondylus , evolved to cope with the coastal shallows and small islands of ancient europe . other dinosaurs rose up to fill the empty space that the jurassic-cretaceous extinction left behind , such as carcharodontosaurus and spinosaurus . of the most successful would be the iguanodon which spread to every continent . seasons came back into effect and the poles got seasonally colder , but dinosaurs still inhabited this area like the leaellynasaura which inhabited the polar forests year-round , and many dinosaurs migrated there during summer like muttaburrasaurus . since it was too cold for crocodiles , it was the last stronghold for large amphibians , like koolasuchus . pterosaurs got larger as species like tapejara and ornithocheirus evolved .
at the foundation of the order , the " medal of the order of the british empire " was instituted , to serve as a lower award granting recipients affiliation but not membership . in 1922 , this was renamed the " british empire medal " . it stopped being awarded by the united kingdom as part of the 1993 reforms to the honours system , but was again awarded beginning in 2012 , starting with 293 bems awarded for the queen 's diamond jubilee . in addition , the bem is awarded by the cook islands and by some other commonwealth nations . in 2004 , a report entitled " a matter of honour : reforming our honours system " by a commons committee recommended to phase out the order of the british empire , as its title was " now considered to be unacceptable , being thought to embody values that are no longer shared by many of the country ’ s population " .
there are several reasons an otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement , most of which involve problems created at the formation of the treaty . [ citation needed ] for example , the serial japan-korea treaties of 1905 , 1907 and 1910 were protested ; and they were confirmed as " already null and void " in the 1965 treaty on basic relations between japan and the republic of korea .
although most hardware clones were not produced under license by nintendo , certain companies were granted licenses to produce nes-compatible devices . the sharp corporation produced at least two such clones : the twin famicom and the sharp 19sc111 television . the twin famicom was compatible with both famicom cartridges and famicom disk system disks . it was available in two colors ( red and black ) and used hardwired controllers ( as did the original famicom ) , but it featured a different case design . the sharp 19sc111 television was a television which included a built-in famicom . a similar licensing deal was reached with hyundai electronics , who licensed the system under the name comboy in the south korean market . this deal with hyundai was made necessary because of the south korean government 's wide ban on all japanese " cultural products " , which remained in effect until 1998 and ensured that the only way japanese products could legally enter the south korean market was through licensing to a third-party ( non-japanese ) distributor ( see also japan–korea disputes ) .
windows 8 introduces a new style of application , windows store apps . according to microsoft developer jensen harris , these apps are to be optimized for touchscreen environments and are more specialized than current desktop applications . apps can run either in a full-screen mode , or be snapped to the side of a screen . apps can provide toast notifications on screen or animate their tiles on the start screen with dynamic content . apps can use " contracts " ; a collection of hooks to provide common functionality that can integrate with other apps , including search and sharing . apps can also provide integration with other services ; for example , the people app can connect to a variety of different social networks and services ( such as facebook , skype , and people service ) , while the photos app can aggregate photos from services such as facebook and flickr .
in separate testimony to financial crisis inquiry commission , officers of clayton holdings—the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the united states and europe—testified that clayton 's review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from january 2006 to june 2007 revealed that scarcely 54 % of the loans met their originators ’ underwriting standards . the analysis ( conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks , including 7 " too big to fail " banks ) additionally showed that 28 % of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer . clayton 's analysis further showed that 39 % of these loans ( i.e . those not meeting any issuer 's minimal underwriting standards ) were subsequently securitized and sold to investors .
in the 19th century , musical institutions emerged from the control of wealthy patrons , as composers and musicians could construct lives independent of the nobility . increasing interest in music by the growing middle classes throughout western europe spurred the creation of organizations for the teaching , performance , and preservation of music . the piano , which achieved its modern construction in this era ( in part due to industrial advances in metallurgy ) became widely popular with the middle class , whose demands for the instrument spurred a large number of piano builders . many symphony orchestras date their founding to this era . some musicians and composers were the stars of the day ; some , like franz liszt and niccolò paganini , fulfilled both roles .
apollo 11 left lunar orbit and returned to earth , landing safely in the pacific ocean on july 24 , 1969 . when the spacecraft splashed down , 2,982 days had passed since kennedy 's commitment to landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth before the end of the decade ; the mission was completed with 161 days to spare . with the safe completion of the apollo 11 mission , the americans won the race to the moon .
in the west , the russians were dissuaded from attacking vidin by the presence of the austrian forces , which had swelled to 280,000 men . on 28 may 1854 a protocol of the vienna conference was signed by austria and russia . one of the aims of the russian advance had been to encourage the orthodox christian serbs and bulgarians living under ottoman rule to rebel . however , when the russian troops actually crossed the river pruth into moldavia , the orthodox christians still showed no interest in rising up against the turks . :131 , 137 adding to the worries of nicholas i was the concern that austria would enter the war against the russians and attack his armies on the western flank . indeed , after attempting to mediate a peaceful settlement between russia and turkey , the austrians entered the war on the side of turkey with an attack against the russians in the principalities which threatened to cut off the russian supply lines . accordingly , the russians were forced to raise the siege of silistra on 23 june 1854 , and begin abandoning the principalities . :185 the lifting of the siege reduced the threat of a russian advance into bulgaria .
all notable wrestlers now enter the ring accompanied by music , and regularly add other elements to their entrance . the music played during the ring entrance will usually mirror the wrestler 's personality . many wrestlers , particularly in america , have music and lyrics specially written for their ring entrance . while invented long before , the practice of including music with the entrance gained rapid popularity during the 1980s , largely as a result of the huge success of hulk hogan and the wwf , and their rock 'n ' wrestling connection . when a match is won , the victor 's theme music is usually also played in celebration .
it authorized the secretary of the interior to list endangered domestic fish and wildlife and allowed the united states fish and wildlife service to spend up to $ 15 million per year to buy habitats for listed species . it also directed federal land agencies to preserve habitat on their lands . the act also consolidated and even expanded authority for the secretary of the interior to manage and administer the national wildlife refuge system . other public agencies were encouraged , but not required , to protect species . the act did not address the commerce in endangered species and parts .
by the early years of the 21st century , western clothing styles had , to some extent , become international styles . this process began hundreds of years earlier , during the periods of european colonialism . the process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world , spreading western culture and styles . fast fashion clothing has also become a global phenomenon . these garments are less expensive , mass-produced western clothing . donated used clothing from western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations .
the story takes place during three years ( 1933–35 ) of the great depression in the fictional " tired old town " of maycomb , alabama , the seat of maycomb county . it focuses on six-year-old jean louise finch ( scout ) , who lives with her older brother , jem , and their widowed father , atticus , a middle-aged lawyer . jem and scout befriend a boy named dill , who visits maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer . the three children are terrified of , and fascinated by , their neighbor , the reclusive arthur " boo " radley . the adults of maycomb are hesitant to talk about boo , and , for many years few have seen him . the children feed one another 's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden , and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house . after two summers of friendship with dill , scout and jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the radley place . several times the mysterious boo makes gestures of affection to the children , but , to their disappointment , he never appears in person .
the dock connector also allowed the ipod to connect to accessories , which often supplement the ipod 's music , video , and photo playback . apple sells a few accessories , such as the now-discontinued ipod hi-fi , but most are manufactured by third parties such as belkin and griffin . some peripherals use their own interface , while others use the ipod 's own screen . because the dock connector is a proprietary interface , the implementation of the interface requires paying royalties to apple .
the manchester small-scale experimental machine , nicknamed baby , was the world 's first stored-program computer . it was built at the victoria university of manchester by frederic c. williams , tom kilburn and geoff tootill , and ran its first program on 21 june 1948 . it was designed as a testbed for the williams tube the first random-access digital storage device . although the computer was considered " small and primitive " by the standards of its time , it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer . as soon as the ssem had demonstrated the feasibility of its design , a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer , the manchester mark 1 .

sanskrit has greatly influenced the languages of india that grew from its vocabulary and grammatical base ; for instance , hindi is a " sanskritised register " of the khariboli dialect . all modern indo-aryan languages , as well as munda and dravidian languages , have borrowed many words either directly from sanskrit ( tatsama words ) , or indirectly via middle indo-aryan languages ( tadbhava words ) . words originating in sanskrit are estimated at roughly fifty percent of the vocabulary of modern indo-aryan languages , as well as the literary forms of malayalam and kannada . literary texts in telugu are lexically sanskrit or sanskritised to an enormous extent , perhaps seventy percent or more .

a broad way of defining adolescence is the transition from child-to-adulthood . according to hogan & astone ( 1986 ) , this transition can include markers such as leaving school , starting a full-time job , leaving the home of origin , getting married , and becoming a parent for the first time . however , the time frame of this transition varies drastically by culture . in some countries , such as the united states , adolescence can last nearly a decade , but in others , the transition—often in the form of a ceremony—can last for only a few days .
current governor of the reserve bank of india raghuram rajan had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the international monetary fund.in 2005 , at a celebration honouring alan greenspan , who was about to retire as chairman of the us federal reserve , rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector . in that paper , " has financial development made the world riskier ? " , rajan " argued that disaster might loom . " rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to " take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but , in return , offer generous compensation the rest of the time . these risks are known as tail risks . but perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise , financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised . "
from 1989 through 1996 , the total area of the us was listed as 9,372,610 km2 ( 3,618,780 sq mi ) ( land + inland water only ) . the listed total area changed to 9,629,091 km2 ( 3,717,813 sq mi ) in 1997 ( great lakes area and coastal waters added ) , to 9,631,418 km2 ( 3,718,711 sq mi ) in 2004 , to 9,631,420 km2 ( 3,718,710 sq mi ) in 2006 , and to 9,826,630 km2 ( 3,794,080 sq mi ) in 2007 ( territorial waters added ) . currently , the cia world factbook gives 9,826,675 km2 ( 3,794,100 sq mi ) , the united nations statistics division gives 9,629,091 km2 ( 3,717,813 sq mi ) , and the encyclopædia britannica gives 9,522,055 km2 ( 3,676,486 sq mi ) ( great lakes area included but not coastal waters ) . these source consider only the 50 states and the federal district , and exclude overseas territories .
filming started in austria in december 2014 , with production taking in the area around sölden—including the ötztal glacier road , rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort and cable car station—and obertilliach and lake altaussee , before concluding in february 2015 . scenes filmed in austria centred on the ice q restaurant , standing in for the fictional hoffler klinik , a private medical clinic in the austrian alps . filming included an action scene featuring a land rover defender bigfoot and a range rover sport . production was temporarily halted first by an injury to craig , who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene , and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured , at least one of them seriously .
drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood , particularly in small specimens . an extreme example is the case of a completely dry spruce block 5 cm in section , which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green ( undried ) block of the same size will .
the investigation of the transmitted signals started immediately after the launch of compass -m1 on 14 april 2007 . soon after in june 2007 , engineers at cnes reported the spectrum and structure of the signals . a month later , researchers from stanford university reported the complete decoding of the “ i ” signals components . the knowledge of the codes allowed a group of engineers at septentrio to build the compass receiver and report tracking and multipath characteristics of the “ i ” signals on e2 and e5b .
since the end of the second world war , france has become an ethnically diverse country . today , approximately five percent of the french population is non-european and non-white . this does not approach the number of non-white citizens in the united states ( roughly 28–37 % , depending on how latinos are classified ; see demographics of the united states ) . nevertheless , it amounts to at least three million people , and has forced the issues of ethnic diversity onto the french policy agenda . france has developed an approach to dealing with ethnic problems that stands in contrast to that of many advanced , industrialized countries . unlike the united states , britain , or even the netherlands , france maintains a " color-blind " model of public policy . this means that it targets virtually no policies directly at racial or ethnic groups . instead , it uses geographic or class criteria to address issues of social inequalities . it has , however , developed an extensive anti-racist policy repertoire since the early 1970s . until recently , french policies focused primarily on issues of hate speech—going much further than their american counterparts—and relatively less on issues of discrimination in jobs , housing , and in provision of goods and services .
stanley crouch wrote in a new york daily news piece " obama 's mother is of white u.s. stock . his father is a black kenyan , " in a column entitled " what obama is n't : black like me . " during the 2008 campaign , the african-american columnist david ehrenstein of the la times accused white liberals of flocking to obama because he was a " magic negro " , a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white ( as cultural protagonists/drivers ) agenda . ehrenstein went on to say " he 's there to assuage white 'guilt ' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in american history . "

the hydraulic crane was invented by sir william armstrong in 1846 , primarily for use at the tyneside docks for loading cargo . these quickly supplanted the earlier steam driven elevators : exploiting pascal 's law , they provided a much greater force . a water pump supplied a variable level of water pressure to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder , allowing the level of the platform ( carrying a heavy load ) to be raised and lowered . counterweights and balances were also used to increase the lifting power of the apparatus .
pope paul vi became the first reigning pontiff ever to visit the americas when he flew to new york in october 1965 to address the united nations . as a gesture of goodwill , the pope gave to the un two pieces of papal jewelry , a diamond cross and ring , with the hopes that the proceeds from their sale at auction would contribute to the un 's efforts to end human suffering . during the pope 's visit , as the u.s. involvement in the vietnam war escalated under president johnson , paul vi pleaded for peace before the un :

in lithuania propria and in samogitia prior to the creation of the kingdom of lithuania by mindaugas , nobles were named die beste leuten in sources that were written in german language . in the lithuanian language nobles were named ponai . the higher nobility were named 'kunigai ' or 'kunigaikščiai ' ( dukes ) —i.e. , loanword from scandinavic konung . they were the established local leaders and warlords . during the development of the state they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes , and later to the king of lithuania . because of expansion of lithuanian duchy into lands of ruthenia in the mid of 14th century a new term appeared to denominate nobility bajorai—from ruthenian ( modern ukrainian and belarusian languages ) бояре . this word to this day is used in lithuanian language to name nobility , not only for own , but also for nobility of other countries .
the traditional buildings of tuvalu used plants and trees from the native broadleaf forest , including timber from : pouka , ( hernandia peltata ) ; ngia or ingia bush , ( pemphis acidula ) ; miro , ( thespesia populnea ) ; tonga , ( rhizophora mucronata ) ; fau or fo fafini , or woman 's fibre tree ( hibiscus tiliaceus ) . and fibre from : coconut ; ferra , native fig ( ficus aspem ) ; fala , screw pine or pandanus . the buildings were constructed without nails and were lashed and tied together with a plaited sennit rope that was handmade from dried coconut fibre .
gorton maintained good relations with the united states and britain , but pursued closer ties with asia . the gorton government experienced a decline in voter support at the 1969 election . state liberal leaders saw his policies as too centralist , while other liberals did n't like his personal behaviour . in 1971 , defence minister malcolm fraser , resigned and said gorton was " not fit to hold the great office of prime minister " . in a vote on the leadership the liberal party split 50/50 , and although this was insufficient to remove him as the leader , gorton decided this was also insufficient support for him , and he resigned .

the map of earthquake intensity published by cea after surveying 500,000 km2 of the affected area shows a maximum liedu of xi on the china seismic intensity scale ( csis ) , described as " very destructive " on the european macroseismic scale ( ems ) from which csis drew reference . ( usgs , using the modified mercalli intensity scale ( cc ) , also placed maximum intensity at xi , " very disastrous " . ) two south-west-north-east stripes of liedu xi are centered around yingxiu , wenchuan ( the town closest to the epicenter of the main quake ) and beichuan ( the town repeatedly struck by strong aftershocks including one registering ms 6.1 on aug 1 , 2008 ) , both in sichuan province , occupying a total of 2,419 km2 . the yingxiu liedu-xi zone is about 66 km long and 20 km wide along wenchuan–dujiangyan–pengzhou ; the beichuan liedu-xi zone is about 82 km long and 15 km wide along an county–beichuan–pingwu . the area with liedu x ( comparable to x on ems , " destructive " and x on mm , " disastrous " ) spans 3,144 km2 . the area affected by earthquakes exceeding liedu vi totals 440,442 km2 , occupying an oval 936 km long and 596 km wide , spanning three provinces and one autonomous region .
with the new millennium , marvel comics emerged from bankruptcy and again began diversifying its offerings . in 2001 , marvel withdrew from the comics code authority and established its own marvel rating system for comics . the first title from this era to not have the code was x-force # 119 ( october 2001 ) . marvel also created new imprints , such as max ( an explicit-content line ) and marvel adventures ( developed for child audiences ) . in addition , the company created an alternate universe imprint , ultimate marvel , that allowed the company to reboot its major titles by revising and updating its characters to introduce to a new generation .
the war started badly for the us and un . north korean forces struck massively in the summer of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered us and rok defenders into the sea . however the united nations intervened , naming douglas macarthur commander of its forces , and un-us-rok forces held a perimeter around pusan , gaining time for reinforcement . macarthur , in a bold but risky move , ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at inchon , cutting off and routing the north koreans and quickly crossing the 38th parallel into north korea . as un forces continued to advance toward the yalu river on the border with communist china , the chinese crossed the yalu river in october and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the un forces reeling back across the 38th parallel . truman originally wanted a rollback strategy to unify korea ; after the chinese successes he settled for a containment policy to split the country . macarthur argued for rollback but was fired by president harry truman after disputes over the conduct of the war . peace negotiations dragged on for two years until president dwight d. eisenhower threatened china with nuclear weapons ; an armistice was quickly reached with the two koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel . north and south korea are still today in a state of war , having never signed a peace treaty , and american forces remain stationed in south korea as part of american foreign policy .
atari games created a line of nes products under the name tengen and took a different approach . the company attempted to reverse engineer the lockout chip to develop its own " rabbit " chip . however , tengen also obtained a description of the lockout chip from the united states patent and trademark office by falsely claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims in a legal case . nintendo sued tengen for copyright infringement , which tengen lost as it could not prove that the legally obtained patent documents had not been used by the reverse engineering team . tengen 's antitrust claims against nintendo were never finally decided .
the baptism of jesus and his crucifixion are considered to be two historically certain facts about jesus . james dunn states that these " two facts in the life of jesus command almost universal assent " and " rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny ' scale of historical facts " that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical jesus . bart ehrman states that the crucifixion of jesus on the orders of pontius pilate is the most certain element about him . john dominic crossan states that the crucifixion of jesus is as certain as any historical fact can be . eddy and boyd state that it is now " firmly established " that there is non-christian confirmation of the crucifixion of jesus . craig blomberg states that most scholars in the third quest for the historical jesus consider the crucifixion indisputable . christopher m. tuckett states that , although the exact reasons for the death of jesus are hard to determine , one of the indisputable facts about him is that he was crucified .

child labour has been a consistent struggle for children in brazil ever since the country was colonized on april 22 , 1550 by pedro álvares cabral . work that many children took part in was not always visible , legal , or paid . free or slave labour was a common occurrence for many youths and was a part of their everyday lives as they grew into adulthood . yet due to there being no clear definition of how to classify what a child or youth is , there has been little historical documentation of child labour during the colonial period . due to this lack of documentation , it is hard to determine just how many children were used for what kinds of work before the nineteenth century . the first documentation of child labour in brazil occurred during the time of indigenous societies and slave labour where it was found that children were forcibly working on tasks that exceeded their emotional and physical limits . armando dias , for example , died in november 1913 whilst still very young , a victim of an electric shock when entering the textile industry where he worked . boys and girls were victims of industrial accidents on a daily basis .
russian border troops were stationed along the tajik–afghan border until summer 2005 . since the september 11 , 2001 attacks , french troops have been stationed at the dushanbe airport in support of air operations of nato 's international security assistance force in afghanistan . united states army and marine corps personnel periodically visit tajikistan to conduct joint training missions of up to several weeks duration . the government of india rebuilt the ayni air base , a military airport located 15 km southwest of dushanbe , at a cost of $ 70 million , completing the repairs in september 2010 . it is now the main base of the tajikistan air force . there have been talks with russia concerning use of the ayni facility , and russia continues to maintain a large base on the outskirts of dushanbe .
in 1901 the accession of edward vii saw new life breathed into the palace . the new king and his wife queen alexandra had always been at the forefront of london high society , and their friends , known as " the marlborough house set " , were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age . buckingham palace—the ballroom , grand entrance , marble hall , grand staircase , vestibules and galleries redecorated in the belle époque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today—once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel king edward 's heavy redecorations were at odds with nash 's original work .

annelids ' cuticles are made of collagen fibers , usually in layers that spiral in alternating directions so that the fibers cross each other . these are secreted by the one-cell deep epidermis ( outermost skin layer ) . a few marine annelids that live in tubes lack cuticles , but their tubes have a similar structure , and mucus-secreting glands in the epidermis protect their skins . under the epidermis is the dermis , which is made of connective tissue , in other words a combination of cells and non-cellular materials such as collagen . below this are two layers of muscles , which develop from the lining of the coelom ( body cavity ) : circular muscles make a segment longer and slimmer when they contract , while under them are longitudinal muscles , usually four distinct strips , whose contractions make the segment shorter and fatter . some annelids also have oblique internal muscles that connect the underside of the body to each side .
traditionally , the first step in most buddhist schools requires taking refuge in the three jewels ( sanskrit : tri-ratna , pāli : ti-ratana ) [ web 19 ] as the foundation of one 's religious practice . the practice of taking refuge on behalf of young or even unborn children is mentioned in the majjhima nikaya , recognized by most scholars as an early text ( cf . infant baptism ) . tibetan buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge , in the lama . in mahayana , the person who chooses the bodhisattva path makes a vow or pledge , considered the ultimate expression of compassion . in mahayana , too , the three jewels are perceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging essence and as having an irreversible effect : " the three jewels have the quality of excellence . just as real jewels never change their faculty and goodness , whether praised or reviled , so are the three jewels ( refuges ) , because they have an eternal and immutable essence . these three jewels bring a fruition that is changeless , for once one has reached buddhahood , there is no possibility of falling back to suffering .
while west had encountered controversy a year prior when he stormed out of the american music awards of 2004 after losing best new artist , the rapper 's first large-scale controversy came just days following late registration 's release , during a benefit concert for hurricane katrina victims . in september 2005 , nbc broadcast a concert for hurricane relief , and west was a featured speaker . when west was presenting alongside actor mike myers , he deviated from the prepared script . myers spoke next and continued to read the script . once it was west 's turn to speak again , he said , " george bush does n't care about black people . " west 's comment reached much of the united states , leading to mixed reactions ; president bush would later call it one of the most " disgusting moments " of his presidency . west raised further controversy in january 2006 when he posed on the cover of rolling stone wearing a crown of thorns .
dec operating systems ( os/8 , rt-11 , rsx-11 , rsts , tops-10 , etc . ) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device ( originally teletype machines ) would work . by the time so-called " glass ttys " ( later called crts or terminals ) came along , the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention . when gary kildall cloned rt-11 to create cp/m he followed established dec convention . until the introduction of pc dos in 1981 , ibm had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless . ibm 's pc dos ( also marketed as ms-dos by microsoft ) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of cp/m , and windows inherited it from ms-dos .
chinese officials canceled the torch relay ceremony amidst disruptions , including a tibetan flag flown from a window in the city hall by green party officials . the third torchbearer in the paris leg , jin jing , who was disabled and carried the torch on a wheelchair , was assaulted several times by unidentified protestors seemingly from the pro-tibet independent camp . in interviews , jin jing said that she was " tugged at , scratched " and " kicked " , but that she " did not feel the pain at the time . " she received praise from ethnic chinese worldwide as " angel in wheelchair " . the chinese government gave the comment that " the chinese respect france a lot " but " paris [ has slapped ] its own face .

reform of the liturgy had been a part of the liturgical movements in the 20th century mainly in france , and germany which were officially recognized by pius xii in his encyclical mediator dei . during the pontificate of pius xii , the vatican eased regulations on the use of latin in roman catholic liturgies , permitting some use of vernacular languages during baptisms , funerals and other events . in 1951 and 1955 , the easter liturgies underwent revision , most notably including the reintroduction of the easter triduum . the second vatican council made no changes to the roman missal , but in the document sacrosanctum concilium mandated that a general revision of it take place . after the vatican council , in april 1969 , paul vi approved the " new order of mass " promulgated in 1970 , as stated in the acta apostolica sedis to " end experimentation " with the mass and which included the introduction of three new eucharistic prayers to what was up to then a single roman canon .
for much of arsenal 's history , their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts , though this has not always been the case . the choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from nottingham forest , soon after arsenal 's foundation in 1886 . two of dial square 's founding members , fred beardsley and morris bates , were former forest players who had moved to woolwich for work . as they put together the first team in the area , no kit could be found , so beardsley and bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball . the shirt was redcurrant , a dark shade of red , and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops .
east prussia enclosed the bulk of the ancestral lands of the baltic old prussians . during the 13th century , the native prussians were conquered by the crusading teutonic knights . the indigenous balts who survived the conquest were gradually converted to christianity . because of germanization and colonisation over the following centuries , germans became the dominant ethnic group , while poles and lithuanians formed minorities . from the 13th century , east prussia was part of the monastic state of the teutonic knights . after the second peace of thorn in 1466 it became a fief of the kingdom of poland . in 1525 , with the prussian homage , the province became the duchy of prussia . the old prussian language had become extinct by the 17th or early 18th century .
for years burke pursued impeachment efforts against warren hastings , formerly governor-general of bengal , that resulted in the trial during 1786 . his interaction with the british dominion of india began well before hastings ' impeachment trial . for two decades prior to the impeachment , parliament had dealt with the indian issue . this trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation . in 1781 burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the east india company when he was appointed chairman of the commons select committee on east indian affairs—from that point until the end of the trial ; india was burke 's primary concern . this committee was charged " to investigate alleged injustices in bengal , the war with hyder ali , and other indian difficulties " . while burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters , a second 'secret ' committee was formed to assess the same issues . both committee reports were written by burke . among other purposes , the reports conveyed to the indian princes that britain would not wage war on them , along with demanding that the heic recall hastings . this was burke 's first call for substantive change regarding imperial practices . when addressing the whole house of commons regarding the committee report , burke described the indian issue as one that " began 'in commerce ' but 'ended in empire . ' "

the byzantine empire was able to take advantage of the turmoil to expand its political influence and commercial relationships , first with the khazars and later with the rus ' and other steppe groups . the byzantines established the theme of cherson , formally known as klimata , in the crimea in the 830s to defend against raids by the rus ' and to protect vital grain shipments supplying constantinople . cherson also served as a key diplomatic link with the khazars and others on the steppe , and it became the centre of black sea commerce . the byzantines also helped the khazars build a fortress at sarkel on the don river to protect their northwest frontier against incursions by the turkic migrants and the rus ' , and to control caravan trade routes and the portage between the don and volga rivers .
the united kingdom and ireland have separate media , although british television , newspapers and magazines are widely available in ireland , giving people in ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in the united kingdom . irish newspapers are also available in the uk , and irish state and private television is widely available in northern ireland . [ citation needed ] certain reality tv shows have embraced the whole of the islands , for example the x factor , seasons 3 , 4 and 7 of which featured auditions in dublin and were open to irish voters , whilst the show previously known as britain 's next top model became britain and ireland 's next top model in 2011 . a few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole . for example , the costa book awards are awarded to authors resident in the uk or ireland . the man booker prize is awarded to authors from the commonwealth of nations and ireland . the mercury music prize is handed out every year to the best album from a british or irish musician or group .
western commentators post-9/11 often perceive madaris as places of radical revivalism with a connotation of anti-americanism and radical extremism , frequently associated in the western press with wahhabi attitudes toward non-muslims . in arabic the word madrasa simply means " school " and does not imply a political or religious affiliation , radical or otherwise . madaris have varied curricula , and are not all religious . some madaris in india , for example , have a secularised identity . although early madaris were founded primarily to gain " knowledge of god " they also taught subjects such as mathematics and poetry . for example , in the ottoman empire , " madrasahs had seven categories of sciences that were taught , such as : styles of writing , oral sciences like the arabic language , grammar , rhetoric , and history and intellectual sciences , such as logic . " this is similar to the western world , in which universities began as institutions of the catholic church .
when a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control-s ( xoff , an abbreviation for transmit off ) , it caused the tape reader to stop ; receiving control-q ( xon , " transmit on " ) caused the tape reader to resume . this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a " handshaking " signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow ; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique . on some systems control-s retains its meaning but control-q is replaced by a second control-s to resume output . the 33 asr also could be configured to employ control-r ( dc2 ) and control-t ( dc4 ) to start and stop the tape punch ; on some units equipped with this function , the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively .
in the high villages people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters . the kitchen is separated from the living area ( called the stube , the area of the home heated by a stove ) , and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat . the typical swiss chalet originated in the bernese oberland . chalets often face south or downhill , and are built of solid wood , with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily . stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside , and balconies are sometimes enclosed .
when maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements , such as milling to remove a worn or damaged surface , the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures . the asphalt/bitumen in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes . with some 95 % of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt , a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year . according to industry surveys conducted annually by the federal highway administration and the national asphalt pavement association , more than 99 % of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements , roadbeds , shoulders and embankments .
puerto rico has been discussed as a potential 51st state of the united states . in a 2012 status referendum a majority of voters , 54 % , expressed dissatisfaction with the current political relationship . in a separate question , 61 % of voters supported statehood ( excluding the 26 % of voters who left this question blank ) . on december 11 , 2012 , puerto rico 's legislature resolved to request that the president and the u.s. congress act on the results , end the current form of territorial status and begin the process of admitting puerto rico to the union as a state .
the ottoman empire began to collapse , and in 1908 , the young turk revolution overthrew the government of sultan hamid . in april 1909 , the adana massacre occurred in the adana vilayet of the ottoman empire resulting in the deaths of as many as 20,000–30,000 armenians . the armenians living in the empire hoped that the committee of union and progress would change their second-class status . armenian reform package ( 1914 ) was presented as a solution by appointing an inspector general over armenian issues .
on 25 february 1991 , the pact was declared at an end at a meeting of defense and foreign ministers from the remaining member states meeting in hungary . on 1 july 1991 , the czechoslovak president václav havel formally declared an end to the warsaw treaty organization of friendship , co-operation , and mutual assistance which had been established in 1955 . the ussr itself was dissolved in december 1991 .
the late 1980s saw a series of liberalising economic reforms within libya designed to cope with the decline in oil revenues . in may 1987 , gaddafi announced the start of the " revolution within a revolution " , which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business . restrictions were placed on the activities of the revolutionary committees ; in march 1988 , their role was narrowed by the newly created ministry for mass mobilization and revolutionary leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role , while in august 1988 gaddafi publicly criticised them , asserting that " they deviated , harmed , tortured " and that " the true revolutionary does not practise repression . " in march , hundreds of political prisoners were freed , with gaddafi falsely claiming that there were no further political prisoners in libya . in june , libya 's government issued the great green charter on human rights in the era of the masses , in which 27 articles laid out goals , rights and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in libya , restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition . many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year , although others remained inactive . also in 1989 , the government founded the al-gaddafi international prize for human rights , to be awarded to figures from the third world who had struggled against colonialism and imperialism ; the first year 's winner was south african anti-apartheid activist nelson mandela . from 1994 through to 1997 , the government initiated cleansing committees to root out corruption , particularly in the economic sector .
hellenistic military equipment was generally characterized by an increase in size . hellenistic-era warships grew from the trireme to include more banks of oars and larger numbers of rowers and soldiers as in the quadrireme and quinquereme . the ptolemaic tessarakonteres was the largest ship constructed in antiquity . new siege engines were developed during this period . an unknown engineer developed the torsion-spring catapult ( ca . 360 ) and dionysios of alexandria designed a repeating ballista , the polybolos . preserved examples of ball projectiles range from 4.4 kg to 78 kg ( or over 170 lbs ) . demetrius poliorcetes was notorious for the large siege engines employed in his campaigns , especially during the 12-month siege of rhodes when he had epimachos of athens build a massive 160 ton siege tower named helepolis , filled with artillery .
inheritance in plants follows the same fundamental principles of genetics as in other multicellular organisms . gregor mendel discovered the genetic laws of inheritance by studying inherited traits such as shape in pisum sativum ( peas ) . what mendel learned from studying plants has had far reaching benefits outside of botany . similarly , " jumping genes " were discovered by barbara mcclintock while she was studying maize . nevertheless , there are some distinctive genetic differences between plants and other organisms .
these products include glued laminated timber ( glulam ) , wood structural panels ( including plywood , oriented strand board and composite panels ) , laminated veneer lumber ( lvl ) and other structural composite lumber ( scl ) products , parallel strand lumber , and i-joists . approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991 . the trends suggest that particle board and fiber board will overtake plywood .
the west campus is located about one mile ( 1.6 km ) to the west of the danforth campus in clayton , missouri , and primarily consists of a four-story former department store building housing mostly administrative space . the west campus building was home to the clayton branch of the famous-barr department store until 1990 , when the university acquired the property and adjacent parking and began a series of renovations . today , the basement level houses the west campus library , the university archives , the modern graphic history library , and conference space . the ground level still remains a retail space . the upper floors house consolidated capital gifts , portions of alumni and development , and information systems offices from across the danforth and medical school campuses . there is also a music rehearsal room on the second floor . the west campus is also home to the center for the application of information technologies ( cait ) , which provides it training services .
a significant and far-reaching shift in human subsistence and lifestyle was to be brought about in areas where crop farming and cultivation were first developed : the previous reliance on an essentially nomadic hunter-gatherer subsistence technique or pastoral transhumance was at first supplemented , and then increasingly replaced by , a reliance upon the foods produced from cultivated lands . these developments are also believed to have greatly encouraged the growth of settlements , since it may be supposed that the increased need to spend more time and labor in tending crop fields required more localized dwellings . this trend would continue into the bronze age , eventually giving rise to permanently settled farming towns , and later cities and states whose larger populations could be sustained by the increased productivity from cultivated lands .
due to reciprocity ( discussed above ) the gain of an antenna used for transmitting must be proportional to its effective area when used for receiving . consider an antenna with no loss , that is , one whose electrical efficiency is 100 % . it can be shown that its effective area averaged over all directions must be equal to λ2/4π , the wavelength squared divided by 4π . gain is defined such that the average gain over all directions for an antenna with 100 % electrical efficiency is equal to 1 . therefore , the effective area aeff in terms of the gain g in a given direction is given by :
the final has been played at the rebuilt wembley stadium since it opened , in 2007 . the rebuilding process meant that between 2001 and 2006 they were hosted at the millennium stadium in cardiff in wales . prior to rebuilding , the final was hosted by the original wembley stadium since it opened in 1923 ( being originally named the empire stadium ) . one exception to this 78 year series of empire stadium finals ( including five replays ) was the 1970 replay between leeds and chelsea , held at old trafford in manchester .
birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions . while some birds are generalists , others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements . even within a single habitat , such as a forest , the niches occupied by different species of birds vary , with some species feeding in the forest canopy , others beneath the canopy , and still others on the forest floor . forest birds may be insectivores , frugivores , and nectarivores . aquatic birds generally feed by fishing , plant eating , and piracy or kleptoparasitism . birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds , while vultures are specialised scavengers . avivores are animals that are specialized at preying on birds .
his next theatrical release in that same year was the world war ii film saving private ryan , about a group of u.s. soldiers led by capt . miller ( tom hanks ) sent to bring home a paratrooper whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours , june 5–6 , of the normandy landing . the film was a huge box office success , grossing over $ 481 million worldwide and was the biggest film of the year at the north american box office ( worldwide it made second place after michael bay 's armageddon ) . spielberg won his second academy award for his direction . the film 's graphic , realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as black hawk down and enemy at the gates . the film was also the first major hit for dreamworks , which co-produced the film with paramount pictures ( as such , it was spielberg 's first release from the latter that was not part of the indiana jones series ) . later , spielberg and tom hanks produced a tv mini-series based on stephen ambrose 's book band of brothers . the ten-part hbo mini-series follows easy company of the 101st airborne division 's 506th parachute infantry regiment . the series won a number of awards at the golden globes and the emmys .
the bagmati river which flows through kathmandu is considered a holy river both by hindus and buddhists , and many hindu temples are located on the banks of this river . the importance of the bagmati also lies in the fact that hindus are cremated on its banks , and kirants are buried in the hills by its side . according to the nepali hindu tradition , the dead body must be dipped three times into the bagmati before cremation . the chief mourner ( usually the first son ) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation . many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the bagmati river or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually .
the sangoma is a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family . the training of the sangoma is called " kwetfwasa " . at the end of the training , a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing . the diviner is consulted for various reasons , such the cause of sickness or even death . his diagnosis is based on " kubhula " , a process of communication , through trance , with the natural superpowers . the inyanga ( a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms ) possesses the bone throwing skill ( " kushaya ematsambo " ) used to determine the cause of the sickness .
state banquets also take place in the ballroom ; these formal dinners are held on the first evening of a state visit by a foreign head of state . on these occasions , for up to 170 guests in formal " white tie and decorations " , including tiaras , the dining table is laid with the grand service , a collection of silver-gilt plate made in 1811 for the prince of wales , later george iv . the largest and most formal reception at buckingham palace takes place every november when the queen entertains members of the diplomatic corps . on this grand occasion , all the state rooms are in use , as the royal family proceed through them , beginning at the great north doors of the picture gallery . as nash had envisaged , all the large , double-mirrored doors stand open , reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces , creating a deliberate optical illusion of space and light .
muammar gaddafi was born in a tent near qasr abu hadi , a rural area outside the town of sirte in the deserts of western libya . his family came from a small , relatively un-influential tribal group called the qadhadhfa , who were arabized berber in heritage . his father , mohammad abdul salam bin hamed bin mohammad , was known as abu meniar ( died 1985 ) , and his mother was named aisha ( died 1978 ) ; abu meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder . nomadic bedouins , they were illiterate and kept no birth records . as such , gaddafi 's date of birth is not known with certainty , and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943 , although biographers blundy and lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940 . his parents ' only surviving son , he had three older sisters . gaddafi 's upbringing in bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life . he repeatedly expressed a preference for the desert over the city and retreated to the desert to meditate .
by 1353 , the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of glarus and zug and the lucerne , zürich and bern city states to form the " old confederacy " of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century . the expansion led to increased power and wealth for the federation . by 1460 , the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the rhine to the alps and the jura mountains , particularly after victories against the habsburgs ( battle of sempach , battle of näfels ) , over charles the bold of burgundy during the 1470s , and the success of the swiss mercenaries . the swiss victory in the swabian war against the swabian league of emperor maximilian i in 1499 amounted to de facto independence within the holy roman empire .
in july 2009 , dell apologized after drawing the ire of the taiwanese consumer protection commission for twice refusing to honour a flood of orders against unusually low prices offered on its taiwanese website . in the first instance , dell offered a 19 " lcd panel for $ 15 . in the second instance , dell offered its latitude e4300 notebook at nt $ 18,558 ( us $ 580 ) , 70 % lower than usual price of nt $ 60,900 ( us $ 1900 ) . concerning the e4300 , rather than honour the discount taking a significant loss , the firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to nt $ 20,000 ( us $ 625 ) a customer in compensation . the consumer rights authorities in taiwan fined dell nt $ 1 million ( us $ 31250 ) for customer rights infringements . many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation . a court in southern taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for nt $ 490,000 ( us $ 15,120 ) , less than a third of the normal price . the court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes , as the prestigious firm said the company mispriced its products twice in taiwanese website within 3 weeks .
teenager sanjaya malakar was the season 's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo , and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog vote for the worst and satellite radio personality howard stern , who both encouraged fans to vote for him . however , on april 18 , sanjaya was voted off .
the concept 's origins can potentially be traced back further . jewish law includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws , though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist – notably the principle of hasagat ge'vul ( unfair encroachment ) was used to justify limited-term publisher ( but not author ) copyright in the 16th century . in 500 bce , the government of the greek state of sybaris offered one year 's patent " to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury " .
on july 1 , 1988 , the fourth and last day of a bruising 19th party conference , gorbachev won the backing of the tired delegates for his last-minute proposal to create a new supreme legislative body called the congress of people 's deputies . frustrated by the old guard 's resistance , gorbachev embarked on a set of constitutional changes to try to separate party and state , and thereby isolate his conservative party opponents . detailed proposals for the new congress of people 's deputies were published on october 2 , 1988 , and to enable the creation of the new legislature the supreme soviet , during its november 29–december 1 , 1988 , session , implemented amendments to the 1977 soviet constitution , enacted a law on electoral reform , and set the date of the election for march 26 , 1989 .
in the early 2000s , print media in somalia reached a peak in activity . around 50 newspapers were published in mogadishu alone during this period , including qaran , mogadishu times , sana'a , shabelle press , ayaamaha , mandeeq , sky sport , goal , the nation , dalka , panorama , aayaha nolosha , codka xuriyada and xidigta maanta . in 2003 , as new free electronic media outlets started to proliferate , advertisers increasingly began switching over from print ads to radio and online commercials in order to reach more customers . a number of the broadsheets in circulation subsequently closed down operations , as they were no longer able to cover printing costs in the face of the electronic revolution . in 2012 , the political xog doon and xog ogaal and horyaal sports were reportedly the last remaining newspapers printed in the capital . according to issa farah , a former editor with the dalka broadsheet , newspaper publishing in somalia is likely to experience a resurgence if the national somali printing press is re-opened and the sector is given adequate public support .
the name of the metal was probably first documented by paracelsus , a swiss-born german alchemist , who referred to the metal as " zincum " or " zinken " in his book liber mineralium ii , in the 16th century . the word is probably derived from the german zinke , and supposedly meant " tooth-like , pointed or jagged " ( metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance ) . zink could also imply " tin-like " because of its relation to german zinn meaning tin . yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the persian word سنگ seng meaning stone . the metal was also called indian tin , tutanego , calamine , and spinter .
a major problem in the managing of the luftwaffe was hermann göring . hitler believed the luftwaffe was " the most effective strategic weapon " , and in reply to repeated requests from the kriegsmarine for control over aircraft insisted , " we should never have been able to hold our own in this war if we had not had an undivided luftwaffe " . such principles made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in göring a jealous and damaging defence of his " empire " while removing hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the luftwaffe at either the strategic or operational level . when hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war , he was faced with a political conflict of his own making between himself and göring , which was not fully resolved until the war was almost over . in 1940 and 1941 , göring 's refusal to cooperate with the kriegsmarine denied the entire wehrmacht military forces of the reich the chance to strangle british sea communications , which might have had strategic or decisive effect in the war against the british empire .
namibia 's primary tourism related governing body , the namibia tourism board ( ntb ) , was established by an act of parliament : the namibia tourism board act , 2000 ( act 21 of 2000 ) . its primary objectives are to regulate the tourism industry and to market namibia as a tourist destination . there are also a number of trade associations that represent the tourism sector in namibia , such as the federation of namibia tourism associations ( the umbrella body for all tourism associations in namibia ) , the hospitality association of namibia , the association of namibian travel agents , car rental association of namibia and the tour and safari association of namibia .

fused quartz is a glass made from chemically-pure sio2 ( silica ) . it has excellent thermal shock characteristics , being able to survive immersion in water while red hot . however , its high melting-temperature ( 1723 °c ) and viscosity make it difficult to work with . normally , other substances are added to simplify processing . one is sodium carbonate ( na2co3 , " soda " ) , which lowers the glass transition temperature . the soda makes the glass water-soluble , which is usually undesirable , so lime ( calcium oxide [ cao ] , generally obtained from limestone ) , some magnesium oxide ( mgo ) and aluminium oxide ( al2o3 ) are added to provide for a better chemical durability . the resulting glass contains about 70 to 74 % silica by weight and is called a soda-lime glass . soda-lime glasses account for about 90 % of manufactured glass .
the standard connectors were designed to be robust . because usb is hot-pluggable , the connectors would be used more frequently , and perhaps with less care , than other connectors . many previous connector designs were fragile , specifying embedded component pins or other delicate parts that were vulnerable to bending or breaking . the electrical contacts in a usb connector are protected by an adjacent plastic tongue , and the entire connecting assembly is usually protected by an enclosing metal sheath .

"
in the context of political corruption , a bribe may involve a payment given to a government official in exchange of his use of official powers . bribery requires two participants : one to give the bribe , and one to take it . either may initiate the corrupt offering ; for example , a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed ( or disallowed ) goods , or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage . in some countries the culture of corruption extends to every aspect of public life , making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes . bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do . they may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations . in addition to their role in private financial gain , bribes are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another ( i.e . no financial incentive ) . [ citation needed ] in some developing nations , up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months .
beginning in first decade of the 15th century , jan hus—a roman catholic priest , czech reformist and professor—influenced by john wycliffe 's writings , founded the hussite movement . he strongly advocated his reformist bohemian religious denomination . he was excommunicated and burned at the stake in constance , bishopric of constance in 1415 by secular authorities for unrepentant and persistent heresy . after his execution , a revolt erupted . hussites defeated five continuous crusades proclaimed against them by the pope .
however , the army was hopeless in battle against the western forces , particularly against the young mahmud of ghazni . in the year 1001 , soon after sultan mahmud came to power and was occupied with the qarakhanids north of the hindu kush , jaipal attacked ghazni once more and upon suffering yet another defeat by the powerful ghaznavid forces , near present-day peshawar . after the battle of peshawar , he committed suicide because his subjects thought he had brought disaster and disgrace to the shahi dynasty .
the early currency of the united states did not exhibit faces of presidents , as is the custom now ; although today , by law , only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on united states currency . in fact , the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency , a practice compared to the policies of european monarchs . the currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century ; before that " heads " side of coinage used profile faces and striding , seated , and standing figures from greek and roman mythology and composite native americans . the last coins to be converted to profiles of historic americans were the dime ( 1946 ) and the dollar ( 1971 ) .
a series of swift prussian and german victories in eastern france , culminating in the siege of metz and the battle of sedan , saw the army of the second empire decisively defeated ( napoleon iii had been captured at sedan on 2 september ) . a government of national defence declared the third republic in paris on 4 september and continued the war and for another five months , the german forces fought and defeated new french armies in northern france . following the siege of paris , the capital fell on 28 january 1871 and then a revolutionary uprising called the paris commune seized power in the capital and held it for two months , until it was bloodily suppressed by the regular french army at the end of may 1871 .
following the events in olympia , there were reports that china requested permission to deploy people 's liberation army personnel along the relay route to protect the flame in canberra . australian authorities stated that such a request , if it were to be made , would be refused . chinese officials labeled it a rumor . australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators , following a call by the chinese students and scholars association for chinese australian students to " go defend our sacred torch " against " ethnic degenerate scum and anti-china separatists " . tony goh , chairman of the australian council of chinese organisations , has said the acco would be taking " thousands " of pro-beijing demonstrators to canberra by bus , to support the torch relay . zhang rongan , a chinese australian student organising pro-beijing demonstrations , told the press that chinese diplomats were assisting with the organization of buses , meals and accommodation for pro-beijing demonstrators , and helping them organise a " peaceful show of strength " . foreign minister stephen smith said chinese officials were urging supporters to " turn up and put a point of view " , but that he had no objection to it as long as they remained peaceful .
on 20 june 1995 , the southern baptist convention voted to adopt a resolution renouncing its racist roots and apologizing for its past defense of slavery . more than 20,000 southern baptists registered for the meeting in atlanta . the resolution declared that messengers , as sbc delegates are called , " unwaveringly denounce racism , in all its forms , as deplorable sin " and " lament and repudiate historic acts of evil such as slavery from which we continue to reap a bitter harvest . " it offered an apology to all african-americans for " condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime " and repentance for " racism of which we have been guilty , whether consciously or unconsciously . " although southern baptists have condemned racism in the past , this was the first time the predominantly white convention had dealt specifically with the issue of slavery .
around the 6th century , slavs appeared on byzantine borders in great numbers . [ page needed ] the byzantine records note that grass would not regrow in places where the slavs had marched through , so great were their numbers . after a military movement even the peloponnese and asia minor were reported to have slavic settlements . this southern movement has traditionally been seen as an invasive expansion . by the end of the 6th century , slavs had settled the eastern alps regions .
as a teenager , he was greatly troubled by the metaphysics of aristotle , which he could not understand until he read al-farabi 's commentary on the work . for the next year and a half , he studied philosophy , in which he encountered greater obstacles . in such moments of baffled inquiry , he would leave his books , perform the requisite ablutions , then go to the mosque , and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties . deep into the night , he would continue his studies , and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution . forty times , it is said , he read through the metaphysics of aristotle , till the words were imprinted on his memory ; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure , until one day they found illumination , from the little commentary by farabi , which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams . so great was his joy at the discovery , made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery , that he hastened to return thanks to god , and bestowed alms upon the poor .
in 1860 , north carolina was a slave state , in which one-third of the population was enslaved . this was a smaller proportion than in many southern states . the state did not vote to join the confederacy until president abraham lincoln called on it to invade its sister state , south carolina , becoming the last or second-to-last state to officially join the confederacy . the title of " last to join the confederacy " has been disputed ; although tennessee 's informal secession on may 7 , 1861 , preceded north carolina 's official secession on may 20 , the tennessee legislature did not formally vote to secede until june 8 , 1861 .
although the reformation was a religious movement , it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life : marriage and family , education , the humanities and sciences , the political and social order , the economy , and the arts . protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry . many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries . since about 1950 , women have entered the ministry , and some have assumed leading positions ( e.g . bishops ) , in most protestant churches .
charlemagne planned to continue the frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs , but was unable to do so as only one son , louis the pious ( r. 814–840 ) , was still alive by 813 . just before charlemagne died in 814 , he crowned louis as his successor . louis 's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and , after 829 , civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire . eventually , louis recognised his eldest son lothair i ( d. 855 ) as emperor and gave him italy . louis divided the rest of the empire between lothair and charles the bald ( d. 877 ) , his youngest son . lothair took east francia , comprising both banks of the rhine and eastwards , leaving charles west francia with the empire to the west of the rhineland and the alps . louis the german ( d. 876 ) , the middle child , who had been rebellious to the last , was allowed to keep bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother . the division was disputed . pepin ii of aquitaine ( d. after 864 ) , the emperor 's grandson , rebelled in a contest for aquitaine , while louis the german tried to annex all of east francia . louis the pious died in 840 , with the empire still in chaos .
these christmas music marathons typically start during the week before thanksgiving day and end after christmas day , or sometimes extending to new year 's day . afterwards , the stations usually resume their normal music fare . several stations begin the holiday format much earlier , at the beginning of november . the roots of this tradition can be traced back to the beautiful music and easy listening stations of the 1960s and 1970s .
armenian cuisine is as ancient as the history of armenia , a combination of different tastes and aromas . the food often has quite a distinct aroma . closely related to eastern and mediterranean cuisine , various spices , vegetables , fish , and fruits combine to present unique dishes . the main characteristics of armenian cuisine are a reliance on the quality of the ingredients rather than heavily spicing food , the use of herbs , the use of wheat in a variety of forms , of legumes , nuts , and fruit ( as a main ingredient as well as to sour food ) , and the stuffing of a wide variety of leaves .
the ultimate substantive legacy of principia mathematica is mixed . it is generally accepted that kurt gödel 's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics , there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them , and hence that principia mathematica could never achieve its aims . however , gödel could not have come to this conclusion without whitehead and russell 's book . in this way , principia mathematica 's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals . but beyond this somewhat ironic legacy , the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic , epistemology , and metaphysics .
the pointed arch , one of the defining attributes of gothic , was earlier incorporated into islamic architecture following the islamic conquests of roman syria and the sassanid empire in the seventh century . the pointed arch and its precursors had been employed in late roman and sassanian architecture ; within the roman context , evidenced in early church building in syria and occasional secular structures , like the roman karamagara bridge ; in sassanid architecture , in the parabolic and pointed arches employed in palace and sacred construction .
the modern slavic peoples carry a variety of mitochondrial dna haplogroups and y-chromosome dna haplogroups . yet two paternal haplogroups predominate : r1a1a [ m17 ] and i2a2a [ l69.2=t/s163.2 ] . the frequency of haplogroup r1a ranges from 63.39 % in the sorbs , through 56.4 % in poland , 54 % in ukraine , 52 % in russia , belarus , to 15.2 % in republic of macedonia , 14.7 % in bulgaria and 12.1 % in herzegovina . the correlation between r1a1a [ m17 ] and the speakers of indo-european languages , particularly those of eastern europe ( russian ) and central and southern asia , was noticed in the late 1990s . from this spencer wells and colleagues , following the kurgan hypothesis , deduced that r1a1a arose on the pontic-caspian steppe .
while the ming dynasty traded horses with tibet , it upheld a policy of outlawing border markets in the north , which laird sees as an effort to punish the mongols for their raids and to " drive them from the frontiers of china . " however , after altan khan ( 1507–1582 ) —leader of the tümed mongols who overthrew the oirat mongol confederation 's hegemony over the steppes—made peace with the ming dynasty in 1571 , he persuaded the ming to reopen their border markets in 1573 . this provided the chinese with a new supply of horses that the mongols had in excess ; it was also a relief to the ming , since they were unable to stop the mongols from periodic raiding . laird says that despite the fact that later mongols believed altan forced the ming to view him as an equal , chinese historians argue that he was simply a loyal chinese citizen . by 1578 , altan khan formed a formidable mongol-tibetan alliance with the gelug that the ming viewed from afar without intervention .
it is possible that around 62 million people died in the war ; estimates vary greatly . about 60 % of all casualties were civilians , who died as a result of disease , starvation , genocide ( in particular , the holocaust ) , and aerial bombing . the former soviet union and china suffered the most casualties . estimates place deaths in the soviet union at around 23 million , while china suffered about 10 million . no country lost a greater portion of its population than poland : approximately 5.6 million , or 16 % , of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died .
with the mixture of radio friendly ac tunes with some rock and pop fare also landing on the pop charts , mainstream songs won over many critics in the need to define ac , and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of ac music into mainstream day to day radio play . part of the reason why more and more hot ac stations are forced to change is that less and less new music fits their bill ; most new rock is too alternative for mainstream radio and most new pop is now influenced heavily by dance-pop and electronic dance music .
as of 2006 , the ipod was produced by about 14,000 workers in the u.s. and 27,000 overseas . further , the salaries attributed to this product were overwhelmingly distributed to highly skilled u.s. professionals , as opposed to lower skilled u.s. retail employees or overseas manufacturing labor . one interpretation of this result is that u.s. innovation can create more jobs overseas than domestically .
according to one of her biographers , giles st aubyn , victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life . from july 1832 until just before her death , she kept a detailed journal , which eventually encompassed 122 volumes . after victoria 's death , her youngest daughter , princess beatrice , was appointed her literary executor . beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering victoria 's accession onwards , and burned the originals in the process . despite this destruction , much of the diaries still exist . in addition to beatrice 's edited copy , lord esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before beatrice destroyed them . part of victoria 's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by a. c. benson , hector bolitho , george earle buckle , lord esher , roger fulford , and richard hough among others .
greece has universal health care . in a 2000 world health organization report , its health care system ranked 14th in overall performance of 191 countries surveyed . in a 2013 save the children report , greece was ranked the 19th best country ( out of 176 countries surveyed ) for the state of mothers and newborn babies . in 2010 , there were 138 hospitals with 31,000 beds in the country , but on 1 july 2011 , the ministry for health and social solidarity announced its plans to decrease the number to 77 hospitals with 36,035 beds , as a necessary reform to reduce expenses and further enhance healthcare standards . [ disputed – discuss ] greece 's healthcare expenditures as a percentage of gdp were 9.6 % in 2007 according to a 2011 oecd report , just above the oecd average of 9.5 % . the country has the largest number of doctors-to-population ratio of any oecd country .
after a decade of constant warfare , france and britain signed the treaty of amiens in march 1802 , bringing the revolutionary wars to an end . amiens called for the withdrawal of british troops from recently conquered colonial territories as well as for assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the french republic . with europe at peace and the economy recovering , napoleon 's popularity soared to its highest levels under the consulate , both domestically and abroad . in a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802 , the french public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the consulate permanent , essentially elevating napoleon to dictator for life . whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people to the polls , the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote ( 72 % of all eligible voters ) . there was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime ; the constitution gained approval with over 99 % of the vote . his broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution : article 1 . the french people name , and the senate proclaims napoleon-bonaparte first consul for life . after 1802 , he was generally referred to as napoleon rather than bonaparte .
renewable energy commercialization involves the deployment of three generations of renewable energy technologies dating back more than 100 years . first-generation technologies , which are already mature and economically competitive , include biomass , hydroelectricity , geothermal power and heat . second-generation technologies are market-ready and are being deployed at the present time ; they include solar heating , photovoltaics , wind power , solar thermal power stations , and modern forms of bioenergy . third-generation technologies require continued r & d efforts in order to make large contributions on a global scale and include advanced biomass gasification , hot-dry-rock geothermal power , and ocean energy . as of 2012 , renewable energy accounts for about half of new nameplate electrical capacity installed and costs are continuing to fall .
in january 2008 , kaz hirai , ceo of sony computer entertainment , suggested that the console may start making a profit by early 2009 , stating that , " the next fiscal year starts in april and if we can try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing " and that " [ profitability ] is not a definite commitment , but that is what i would like to try to shoot for " . however , market analysts nikko citigroup have predicted that playstation 3 could be profitable by august 2008 . in a july 2008 interview , hirai stated that his objective is for playstation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year , surpassing playstation 2 's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market . in january 2009 sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in q3 2008 .
in the midrash compilation , genesis rabbah , rabbi berechiah mentions ashkenaz , riphath , and togarmah as german tribes or as german lands . it may correspond to a greek word that may have existed in the greek dialect of the palestinian jews , or the text is corrupted from " germanica . " this view of berechiah is based on the talmud ( yoma 10a ; jerusalem talmud megillah 71b ) , where gomer , the father of ashkenaz , is translated by germamia , which evidently stands for germany , and which was suggested by the similarity of the sound .
the town experienced major expansion during the victorian era . the southampton docks company had been formed in 1835 . in october 1838 the foundation stone of the docks was laid and the first dock opened in 1842 . the structural and economic development of docks continued for the next few decades . the railway link to london was fully opened in may 1840 . southampton subsequently became known as the gateway to the empire .
frances a. m. forbes writes that when the patriarch alexander was on his death-bed he called athanasius , who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made bishop . " when the bishops of the church assembled to elect their new patriarch , the whole catholic population surrounded the church , holding up their hands to heaven and crying ; " give us athanasius ! " the bishops had nothing better . athanasius was thus elected , as gregory tells us ... " ( pope gregory i , would have full access to the vatican archives ) .
malaysia-based yazhou zhoukan conducted an interview with former researcher at the china seismological bureau geng qingguo ( 耿庆国 ) , in which geng claimed that a confidential written report was sent to the state seismological bureau on april 30 , 2008 , warning about the possible occurrence of a significant earthquake in ngawa prefecture region of sichuan around may 8 , with a range of 10 days before or after the quake . geng , while acknowledging that earthquake prediction was broadly considered problematic by the scientific community , believed that " the bigger the earthquake , the easier it is to predict . " geng had long attempted to establish a correlation between the occurrence of droughts and earthquakes ; premier zhou enlai reportedly took an interest in geng 's work . geng 's drought-earthquake correlation theory was first released in 1972 , and said to have successfully predicted the 1975 haicheng and 1976 tangshan earthquakes . the same yazhou zhoukan article pointed out the inherent difficulties associated with predicting earthquakes . in response , an official with the seismological bureau stated that " earthquake prediction is widely acknowledged around the world to be difficult from a scientific standpoint . " the official also denied that the seismological bureau had received reports predicting the earthquake .
many smaller clans mentioned within early literature seem to have been present across the rest of the subcontinent . some of these kings were hereditary ; other states elected their rulers . early " republics " such as the vajji ( or vriji ) confederation centered in the city of vaishali , existed as early as the 6th century bce and persisted in some areas until the 4th century ce . the educated speech at that time was sanskrit , while the languages of the general population of northern india are referred to as prakrits . many of the sixteen kingdoms had coalesced to four major ones by 500/400 bce , by the time of gautama buddha . these four were vatsa , avanti , kosala , and magadha . the life of gautam budhha was mainly associated with these four kingdoms .
in the first post war years tito was widely considered a communist leader very loyal to moscow , indeed , he was often viewed as second only to stalin in the eastern bloc . in fact , stalin and tito had an uneasy alliance from the start , with stalin considering tito too independent .
from the annexation of alsace by france in the 17th century and the language policy of the french revolution up to 1870 , knowledge of french in alsace increased considerably . with the education reforms of the 19th century , the middle classes began to speak and write french well . the french language never really managed , however , to win over the masses , the vast majority of whom continued to speak their german dialects and write in german ( which we would now call " standard german " ) .

following the ottoman ultimatum in september 1853 , forces under the ottoman general omar pasha crossed the danube at vidin and captured calafat in october 1853 . simultaneously , in the east , the ottomans crossed the danube at silistra and attacked the russians at oltenița . the resulting battle of oltenița was the first engagement following the declaration of war . the russians counterattacked , but were beaten back . on 31 december 1853 , the ottoman forces at calafat moved against the russian force at chetatea or cetate , a small village nine miles north of calafat , and engaged them on 6 january 1854 . the battle began when the russians made a move to recapture calafat . most of the heavy fighting , however , took place in and around chetatea until the russians were driven out of the village . despite the setback at chetatea , on 28 january 1854 , russian forces laid siege to calafat . the siege would continue until may 1854 when the russians lifted the siege . the ottomans would also later beat the russians in battle at caracal . :130–43
in the 1960s , the term bandes dessinées ( " drawn strips " ) came into wide use in french to denote the medium . cartoonists began creating comics for mature audiences , and the term " ninth art " [ e ] was coined , as comics began to attract public and academic attention as an artform . a group including rené goscinny and albert uderzo founded the magazine pilote in 1959 to give artists greater freedom over their work . goscinny and uderzo 's the adventures of asterix appeared in it and went on to become the best-selling french-language comics series . from 1960 , the satirical and taboo-breaking hara-kiri defied censorship laws in the countercultural spirit that led to the may 1968 events .
yale 's residential college system was established in 1933 by edward s. harkness , who admired the social intimacy of oxford and cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at yale and harvard . though yale 's colleges resemble their english precursors organizationally and architecturally , they are dependent entities of yale college and have limited autonomy . the colleges are led by a master and an academic dean , who reside in the college , and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college 's fellowship . colleges offer their own seminars , social events , and speaking engagements known as " master 's teas , " but do not contain programs of study or academic departments . instead , all undergraduate courses are taught by the faculty of arts and sciences and are open to members of any college .
this eventually led to lbj 's civil rights act , which came shortly after president kennedy 's assassination . this document was more holistic than any president kennedy had offered , and therefore more controversial . it aimed not only to integrate public facilities , but also private businesses that sold to the public , such as motels , restaurants , theaters , and gas stations . public schools , hospitals , libraries , parks , among other things , were included in the bill as well . it also worked with jfk 's executive order 11114 by prohibiting discrimination in the awarding of federal contracts and holding the authority of the government to deny contracts to businesses who discriminate . maybe most significant of all , title vii of the civil rights act aimed to end discrimination in all firms with 25 or more employees . another provision established the equal employment opportunity commission as the agency charged with ending discrimination in the nation 's workplace . :74
victoria married her first cousin , prince albert of saxe-coburg and gotha , in 1840 . their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent , tying them together and earning her the sobriquet " the grandmother of europe " . after albert 's death in 1861 , victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances . as a result of her seclusion , republicanism temporarily gained strength , but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered . her golden and diamond jubilees were times of public celebration .
like finnish , estonian employs the latin script as the basis for its alphabet , which adds the letters ä , ö , ü , and õ , plus the later additions š and ž . the letters c , q , w , x and y are limited to proper names of foreign origin , and f , z , š , and ž appear in loanwords and foreign names only . ö and ü are pronounced similarly to their equivalents in swedish and german . unlike in standard german but like finnish and swedish ( when followed by 'r ' ) , ä is pronounced [ æ ] , as in english mat . the vowels ä , ö and ü are clearly separate phonemes and inherent in estonian , although the letter shapes come from german . the letter õ denotes /ɤ/ , unrounded /o/ , or a close-mid back unrounded vowel . it is almost identical to the bulgarian ъ /ɤ̞/ and the vietnamese ơ , and is used to transcribe the russian ы .
coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs . leopards in particular are known to have a predilection for dogs , and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of the dog 's size or ferocity . tigers in manchuria , indochina , indonesia , and malaysia are reputed to kill dogs with the same vigor as leopards . striped hyenas are major predators of village dogs in turkmenistan , india , and the caucasus . reptiles such as alligators and pythons have been known to kill and eat dogs .
in 2012 , the state elected a republican governor ( pat mccrory ) and lieutenant governor ( dan forest ) for the first time in more than two decades , while also giving the republicans veto-proof majorities in both the state house of representatives and the state senate . several u.s. house of representatives seats also flipped control , with the republicans holding nine seats to the democrats ' four . in the 2014 mid-term elections , republican david rouzer won the state 's seventh congressional district seat , increasing the congressional delegation party split to 10-3 in favor of the gop .
by 1790 , the jewish population of alsace was approximately 22,500 , about 3 % of the provincial population . they were highly segregated and subject to long-standing anti-jewish regulations . they maintained their own customs , yiddish language , and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos ; they adhered to talmudic law enforced by their rabbis . jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages . they concentrated in trade , services , and especially in money lending . they financed about a third of the mortgages in alsace . official tolerance grew during the french revolution , with full emancipation in 1791 . however , local antisemitism also increased and napoleon turned hostile in 1806 , imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to jews . [ citation needed ] in the 1830-1870 era most jews moved to the cities , where they integrated and acculturated , as antisemitism sharply declined . by 1831 , the state began paying salaries to official rabbis , and in 1846 a special legal oath for jews was discontinued . antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred , especially during the revolution of 1848 . merger of alsace into germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence .
many of the writers in the tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously : for instance , the poet namik kemal also wrote the important 1876 novel intibâh ( " awakening " ) , while the journalist ibrahim şinasi is noted for writing , in 1860 , the first modern turkish play , the one-act comedy " şair evlenmesi " ( " the poet 's marriage " ) . an earlier play , a farce entitled " vakâyi'-i 'acibe ve havâdis-i garibe-yi kefşger ahmed " ( " the strange events and bizarre occurrences of the cobbler ahmed " ) , dates from the beginning of the 19th century , but there remains some doubt about its authenticity . in a similar vein , the novelist ahmed midhat efendi wrote important novels in each of the major movements : romanticism ( hasan mellâh yâhud sırr içinde esrâr , 1873 ; " hasan the sailor , or the mystery within the mystery " ) , realism ( henüz on yedi yaşında , 1881 ; " just seventeen years old " ) , and naturalism ( müşâhedât , 1891 ; " observations " ) . this diversity was , in part , due to the tanzimat writers ' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible , in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of ottoman social structures .
versions of revived palladian architecture dominated english country house architecture . houses were increasingly placed in grand landscaped settings , and large houses were generally made wide and relatively shallow , largely to look more impressive from a distance . the height was usually highest in the centre , and the baroque emphasis on corner pavilions often found on the continent generally avoided . in grand houses , an entrance hall led to steps up to a piano nobile or mezzanine floor where the main reception rooms were . typically the basement area or " rustic " , with kitchens , offices and service areas , as well as male guests with muddy boots , came some way above ground , and was lit by windows that were high on the inside , but just above ground level outside . a single block was typical , with a perhaps a small court for carriages at the front marked off by railings and a gate , but rarely a stone gatehouse , or side wings around the court .
the element was probably named by the alchemist paracelsus after the german word zinke ( prong , tooth ) . german chemist andreas sigismund marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746 . work by luigi galvani and alessandro volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800 . corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron ( hot-dip galvanizing ) is the major application for zinc . other applications are in batteries , small non-structural castings , and alloys , such as brass . a variety of zinc compounds are commonly used , such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate ( as dietary supplements ) , zinc chloride ( in deodorants ) , zinc pyrithione ( anti-dandruff shampoos ) , zinc sulfide ( in luminescent paints ) , and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory .
rocket-propelled grenades can be—and often are—used against hovering helicopters ( e.g. , by somali militiamen during the battle of mogadishu ( 1993 ) ) . firing an rpg at steep angles poses a danger to the user , because the backblast from firing reflects off the ground . in somalia , militia members sometimes welded a steel plate in the exhaust end of an rpg 's tube to deflect pressure away from the shooter when shooting up at us helicopters . rpgs are used in this role only when more effective weapons are not available .
in 1975 , the most prominent government reforms regarding family law in a muslim country were set in motion in the somali democratic republic , which put women and men , including husbands and wives , on complete equal footing . the 1975 somali family law gave men and women equal division of property between the husband and wife upon divorce and the exclusive right to control by each spouse over his or her personal property .
other city states formed federated states in self-defense , such as the aetolian league ( est . 370 bce ) , the achaean league ( est . 280 bce ) , the boeotian league , the " northern league " ( byzantium , chalcedon , heraclea pontica and tium ) and the " nesiotic league " of the cyclades . these federations involved a central government which controlled foreign policy and military affairs , while leaving most of the local governing to the city states , a system termed sympoliteia . in states such as the achaean league , this also involved the admission of other ethnic groups into the federation with equal rights , in this case , non-achaeans . the achean league was able to drive out the macedonians from the peloponnese and free corinth , which duly joined the league .
germany is a federal republic consisting of sixteen federal states ( german : bundesland , or land ) . [ a ] since today 's germany was formed from an earlier collection of several states , it has a federal constitution , and the constituent states retain a measure of sovereignty . with an emphasis on geographical conditions , berlin and hamburg are frequently called stadtstaaten ( city-states ) , as is the free hanseatic city of bremen , which in fact includes the cities of bremen and bremerhaven . the remaining 13 states are called flächenländer ( literally : area states ) .
georgian architecture was widely disseminated in the english colonies during the georgian era . american buildings of the georgian period were very often constructed of wood with clapboards ; even columns were made of timber , framed up , and turned on an over-sized lathe . at the start of the period the difficulties of obtaining and transporting brick or stone made them a common alternative only in the larger cities , or where they were obtainable locally . dartmouth college , harvard university , and the college of william and mary , offer leading examples of georgian architecture in the americas .
the scholarly term for research concerning somalis and greater somalia is known as somali studies . it consists of several disciplines such as anthropology , sociology , linguistics , historiography and archaeology . the field draws from old somali chronicles , records and oral literature , in addition to written accounts and traditions about somalis from explorers and geographers in the horn of africa and the middle east . since 1980 , prominent somalist scholars from around the world have also gathered annually to hold the international congress of somali studies .
the new kingdom c. 1550–1070 bc began with the eighteenth dynasty , marking the rise of egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as tombos in nubia , and included parts of the levant in the east . this period is noted for some of the most well known pharaohs , including hatshepsut , thutmose iii , akhenaten and his wife nefertiti , tutankhamun and ramesses ii . the first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as atenism . frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the new kingdom . the country was later invaded and conquered by libyans , nubians and assyrians , but native egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country .
during his time as an american envoy to france , benjamin franklin , publisher of the old english proverb , " early to bed , and early to rise , makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise " , anonymously published a letter suggesting that parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight . this 1784 satire proposed taxing shutters , rationing candles , and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise . despite common misconception , franklin did not actually propose dst ; 18th-century europe did not even keep precise schedules . however , this soon changed as rail and communication networks came to require a standardization of time unknown in franklin 's day .
detroit remains one of the most racially segregated cities in the united states . from the 1940s to the 1970s a second wave of blacks moved to detroit to escape jim crow laws in the south and find jobs . however , they soon found themselves excluded from white areas of the city—through violence , laws , and economic discrimination ( e.g. , redlining ) . white residents attacked black homes : breaking windows , starting fires , and exploding bombs . the pattern of segregation was later magnified by white migration to the suburbs . one of the implications of racial segregation , which correlates with class segregation , may be overall worse health for some populations .
russell moved the watch tower society 's headquarters to brooklyn , new york , in 1909 , combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship ; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named bethel . he identified the religious movement as " bible students , " and more formally as the international bible students association . by 1910 , about 50,000 people worldwide were associated with the movement and congregations re-elected him annually as their " pastor . " russell died october 31 , 1916 , at the age of 64 while returning from a ministerial speaking tour .
the small woolen dolls called maniae , hung on the compitalia shrines , were thought a symbolic replacement for child-sacrifice to mania , as mother of the lares . the junii took credit for its abolition by their ancestor l. junius brutus , traditionally rome 's republican founder and first consul . political or military executions were sometimes conducted in such a way that they evoked human sacrifice , whether deliberately or in the perception of witnesses ; marcus marius gratidianus was a gruesome example .

on april 22 , 1971 , kerry appeared before a u.s. senate committee hearing on proposals relating to ending the war . the day after this testimony , kerry participated in a demonstration with thousands of other veterans in which he and other vietnam war veterans threw their medals and service ribbons over a fence erected at the front steps of the united states capitol building to dramatize their opposition to the war . jack smith , a marine , read a statement explaining why the veterans were returning their military awards to the government . for more than two hours , almost 1000 angry veterans tossed their medals , ribbons , hats , jackets , and military papers over the fence . each veteran gave his or her name , hometown , branch of service and a statement . kerry threw some of his own decorations and awards as well as some given to him by other veterans to throw . as kerry threw his decorations over the fence , his statement was : " i 'm not doing this for any violent reasons , but for peace and justice , and to try and make this country wake up once and for all . "
unique to the development of dutch is the collaps of older ol/ul/al + dental into ol + dental , followed by vocalisation of pre-consonantal /l/ and after a short vowel , creating the diphthong /ɑu/ e.g. , dutch goud , zout and bout corresponds with low german gold , solt , bolt ; german gold , salz , balt and english gold , salt , bold . this is the most common diphthong along with /ɛi œy/ . all three are commonly the only ones considered unique phonemes in dutch . the tendency for native english speakers is to pronounce dutch names with /ɛi/ ( written as ij or ei ) as /aɪ/ , ( like the english vowel y ) which does not normally lead to confusion among native listeners , since in a number of dialects ( e.g . in amsterdam ) the same pronunciation is heard .
although not yet tested as a therapy in humans , a growing body of evidence indicates that zinc may preferentially kill prostate cancer cells . because zinc naturally homes to the prostate and because the prostate is accessible with relatively non-invasive procedures , its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent in this type of cancer has shown promise . however , other studies have demonstrated that chronic use of zinc supplements in excess of the recommended dosage may actually increase the chance of developing prostate cancer , also likely due to the natural buildup of this heavy metal in the prostate .
like other languages , catalan has a large list of learned words from greek and latin . this process started very early , and one can find such examples in ramon llull 's work . on the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries catalan had a number of greco-latin learned words much superior to other romance languages , as it can be attested for example in roís de corella 's writings .
in south australia , initially a liberal and country party affiliated party , the liberal and country league ( lcl ) , mostly led by premier of south australia tom playford , was in power from the 1933 election to the 1965 election , though with assistance from an electoral malapportionment , or gerrymander , known as the playmander . the lcl 's steele hall governed for one term from the 1968 election to the 1970 election and during this time began the process of dismantling the playmander . david tonkin , as leader of the south australian division of the liberal party of australia , became premier at the 1979 election for one term , losing office at the 1982 election . the liberals returned to power at the 1993 election , led by premiers dean brown , john olsen and rob kerin through two terms , until their defeat at the 2002 election . they have since remained in opposition under a record five opposition leaders .
for instance , a common use of a database system is to track information about users , their name , login information , various addresses and phone numbers . in the navigational approach all of this data would be placed in a single record , and unused items would simply not be placed in the database . in the relational approach , the data would be normalized into a user table , an address table and a phone number table ( for instance ) . records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided .
musée territorial de st.-barthélemy is a historical museum known as the " st. barts municipal museum " also called the " wall house " ( musée – bibliothèque ) in gustavia , which is located on the far end of la pointe . the museum is housed in an old stone house , a two-storey building which has been refurbished . the island ’ s history relating to french , swedish and british period of occupation is well presented in the museum with photographs , maps and paintings . also on display are the ancestral costumes , antique tools , models of creole houses and ancient fishing boats . it also houses a library .
in a nonpartisan system , no official political parties exist , sometimes reflecting legal restrictions on political parties . in nonpartisan elections , each candidate is eligible for office on his or her own merits . in nonpartisan legislatures , there are no typically formal party alignments within the legislature . the administration of george washington and the first few sessions of the united states congress were nonpartisan . washington also warned against political parties during his farewell address . in the united states , the unicameral legislature of nebraska is nonpartisan but is elected and votes on informal party lines . in canada , the territorial legislatures of the northwest territories and nunavut are nonpartisan . in new zealand , tokelau has a nonpartisan parliament . many city and county governments [ vague ] are nonpartisan . nonpartisan elections and modes of governance are common outside of state institutions . unless there are legal prohibitions against political parties , factions within nonpartisan systems often evolve into political parties .
season four premiered on january 18 , 2005 ; this was the first season of the series to be aired in high definition , although the finale of season three was also aired in high definition . the number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season . the age limit was raised to 28 in this season , and among those who benefited from this new rule were constantine maroulis and bo bice , the two rockers of the show .
during the hellenistic period , many different schools of thought developed . athens , with its multiple philosophical schools , continued to remain the center of philosophical thought . however athens had now lost her political freedom and hellenistic philosophy is a reflection of this new difficult period . in this political climate , hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as ataraxia ( un-disturbedness ) , autarky ( self-sufficiency ) and apatheia ( freedom from suffering ) , which would allow them to wrest well-being or eudaimonia out of the most difficult turns of fortune . this occupation with the inner life , with personal inner liberty and with the pursuit of eudaimonia is what all hellenistic philosophical schools have in common .
the greeks of the classical era made several notable contributions to science and helped lay the foundations of several western scientific traditions , like philosophy , historiography and mathematics . the scholarly tradition of the greek academies was maintained during roman times with several academic institutions in constantinople , antioch , alexandria and other centres of greek learning while eastern roman science was essentially a continuation of classical science . greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in paideia ( education ) . paideia was one of the highest societal values in the greek and hellenistic world while the first european institution described as a university was founded in 5th century constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the city 's fall to the ottomans in 1453 . the university of constantinople was christian europe 's first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught , and considering the original meaning of the world university as a corporation of students , the world ’ s first university as well .
the odrysian kingdom was a union of thracian tribes under the kings of the powerful odrysian tribe centered around the region of thrace . various parts of thrace were under macedonian rule under philip ii of macedon , alexander the great , lysimachus , ptolemy ii , and philip v but were also often ruled by their own kings . the thracians and agrianes were widely used by alexander as peltasts and light cavalry , forming about one fifth of his army . the diadochi also used thracian mercenaries in their armies and they were also used as colonists . the odrysians used greek as the language of administration and of the nobility . the nobility also adopted greek fashions in dress , ornament and military equipment , spreading it to the other tribes . thracian kings were among the first to be hellenized .
evidence of anatomically modern humans in the indian subcontinent is recorded as long as 75,000 years ago , or with earlier hominids including homo erectus from about 500,000 years ago . the indus valley civilization which spread and flourished in the northwestern part of the indian subcontinent from c. 3200 to 1300 bce , was the first major civilization in south asia . a sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the mature harappan period , from 2600 to 1900 bce . this civilization collapsed at the start of the second millennium bce and was later followed by the iron age vedic civilization , which extended over much of the indo-gangetic plain and which witnessed the rise of major polities known as the mahajanapadas . in one of these kingdoms , magadha , mahavira and gautama buddha propagated their shramanic philosophies during the fifth and sixth century bce .
historically , the name armenian has come to internationally designate this group of people . it was first used by neighbouring countries of ancient armenia . the earliest attestations of the exonym armenia date around the 6th century bc . in his trilingual behistun inscription dated to 517 bc , darius i the great of persia refers to urashtu ( in babylonian ) as armina ( in old persian ; armina ( ) and harminuya ( in elamite ) . in greek , αρμένιοι " armenians " is attested from about the same time , perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to hecataeus of miletus ( 476 bc ) . xenophon , a greek general serving in some of the persian expeditions , describes many aspects of armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 bc . he relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the persians .
much of youtube 's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos . in 2010 it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders . youtube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue . in may 2013 , nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games . in february 2015 , nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators .
in the revival movement france held a foremost place , owing to the reputation and convincing power of the orator , jean-baptiste henri lacordaire ( 1802–1861 ) . he took the habit of a friar preacher at rome ( 1839 ) , and the province of france was canonically erected in 1850 . from this province were detached the province of lyon , called occitania ( 1862 ) , that of toulouse ( 1869 ) , and that of canada ( 1909 ) . the french restoration likewise furnished many laborers to other provinces , to assist in their organization and progress . from it came the master general who remained longest at the head of the administration during the 19th century , père vincent jandel ( 1850–1872 ) . here should be mentioned the province of st. joseph in the united states . founded in 1805 by edward fenwick , afterwards first bishop of cincinnati , ohio ( 1821–1832 ) , this province has developed slowly , but now ranks among the most flourishing and active provinces of the order . in 1910 it numbered seventeen convents or secondary houses . in 1905 , it established a large house of studies at washington , d.c. , called the dominican house of studies . there are now four dominican provinces in the united states .
the defined dogma of the immaculate conception regards original sin only , saying that mary was preserved from any stain ( in latin , macula or labes , the second of these two synonymous words being the one used in the formal definition ) . the proclaimed roman catholic dogma states " that the most blessed virgin mary , in the first instance of her conception , by a singular grace and privilege granted by almighty god , in view of the merits of jesus christ , the saviour of the human race , was preserved free from all stain of original sin . " therefore , being always free from original sin , the doctrine teaches that from her conception mary received the sanctifying grace that would normally come with baptism after birth .
although stovl aircraft are capable of taking off vertically from a spot on the deck , using the ramp and a running start is far more fuel efficient and permits a heavier launch weight . as catapults are unnecessary , carriers with this arrangement reduce weight , complexity , and space needed for complex steam or electromagnetic launching equipment , vertical landing aircraft also remove the need for arresting cables and related hardware . russian , chinese , and future indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier arresting cables and a tailhook on their aircraft .
the arena football league ( afl ) is the highest level of professional indoor american football in the united states . it was founded in 1987 by jim foster , making it the third longest-running professional football league in north america , after the canadian football league and the national football league . it is played indoors on a 68-yard field ( about half the distance of an nfl field ) , resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game . the sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by foster , a former executive of the united states football league and the national football league .
a computer 's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read . each cell has a numbered " address " and can store a single number . the computer can be instructed to " put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357 " or to " add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595 . " the information stored in memory may represent practically anything . letters , numbers , even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease . since the cpu does not differentiate between different types of information , it is the software 's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers .
palermo is surrounded by mountains , formed of calcar , which form a cirque around the city . some districts of the city are divided by the mountains themselves . historically , it was relatively difficult to reach the inner part of sicily from the city because of the mounts . the tallest peak of the range is la pizzuta , about 1,333 m ( 4,373 ft. ) high . however , historically , the most important mount is monte pellegrino , which is geographically separated from the rest of the range by a plain . the mount lies right in front of the tyrrhenian sea . monte pellegrino 's cliff was described in the 19th century by johann wolfgang von goethe , as " the most beautiful promontory in the world " , in his essay " italian journey " .
in additive color devices such as computer displays and televisions , one of the primary light sources is typically a narrow-spectrum yellowish-green of dominant wavelength ~550 nm ; this " green " primary is combined with an orangish-red " red " primary and a purplish-blue " blue " primary to produce any color in between – the rgb color model . a unique green ( green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish ) is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary .
in the classical era , several ancient city-states such as opone , essina , sarapion , nikon , malao , damo and mosylon near cape guardafui , which competed with the sabaeans , parthians and axumites for the wealthy indo-greco-roman trade , also flourished in somalia .
elizabeth was born at 02:40 ( gmt ) on 21 april 1926 , during the reign of her paternal grandfather , king george v. her father , prince albert , duke of york ( later king george vi ) , was the second son of the king . her mother , elizabeth , duchess of york ( later queen elizabeth ) , was the youngest daughter of scottish aristocrat claude bowes-lyon , 14th earl of strathmore and kinghorne . she was delivered by caesarean section at her maternal grandfather 's london house : 17 bruton street , mayfair . she was baptised by the anglican archbishop of york , cosmo gordon lang , in the private chapel of buckingham palace on 29 may , [ c ] and named elizabeth after her mother , alexandra after george v 's mother , who had died six months earlier , and mary after her paternal grandmother . called " lilibet " by her close family , based on what she called herself at first , she was cherished by her grandfather george v , and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery .
uranium 's average concentration in the earth 's crust is ( depending on the reference ) 2 to 4 parts per million , or about 40 times as abundant as silver . the earth 's crust from the surface to 25 km ( 15 mi ) down is calculated to contain 1017 kg ( 2×1017 lb ) of uranium while the oceans may contain 1013 kg ( 2×1013 lb ) . the concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million ( up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers ) , and its concentration in sea water is 3 parts per billion .
above the sessions exist presbyteries , which have area responsibilities . these are composed of teaching elders and ruling elders from each of the constituent congregations . the presbytery sends representatives to a broader regional or national assembly , generally known as the general assembly , although an intermediate level of a synod sometimes exists . this congregation / presbytery / synod / general assembly schema is based on the historical structure of the larger presbyterian churches , such as the church of scotland or the presbyterian church ( u.s.a. ) ; some bodies , such as the presbyterian church in america and the presbyterian church in ireland , skip one of the steps between congregation and general assembly , and usually the step skipped is the synod . the church of scotland has now abolished the synod .

kanye west began his early production career in the mid-1990s , making beats primarily for burgeoning local artists , eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic soul records . his first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on down to earth , the 1996 debut album of a chicago rapper named grav . for a time , west acted as a ghost producer for deric " d-dot " angelettie . because of his association with d-dot , west was n't able to release a solo album , so he formed and became a member and producer of the go-getters , a late-1990s chicago rap group composed of him , glc , timmy g , really doe , and arrowstar . his group was managed by john " monopoly " johnson , don crowley , and happy lewis under the management firm hustle period . after attending a series of promotional photo shoots and making some radio appearances , the go-getters released their first and only studio album world record holders in 1999 . the album featured other chicago-based rappers such as rhymefest , mikkey halsted , miss criss , and shayla g. meanwhile , the production was handled by west , arrowstar , boogz , and brian " all day " miller .
ibm started working on a prototype system loosely based on codd 's concepts as system r in the early 1970s . the first version was ready in 1974/5 , and work then started on multi-table systems in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record ( some of which is optional ) did not have to be stored in a single large " chunk " . subsequent multi-user versions were tested by customers in 1978 and 1979 , by which time a standardized query language – sql [ citation needed ] – had been added . codd 's ideas were establishing themselves as both workable and superior to codasyl , pushing ibm to develop a true production version of system r , known as sql/ds , and , later , database 2 ( db2 ) .
he assumed duties again at camp meade , maryland , commanding a battalion of tanks , where he remained until 1922 . his schooling continued , focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it . his new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with george s. patton , sereno e. brett , and other senior tank leaders . their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors , who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry . eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment , and he relented .
in 1238 , king james i of aragon , with an army composed of aragonese , catalans , navarrese and crusaders from the order of calatrava , laid siege to valencia and on 28 september obtained a surrender . fifty thousand moors were forced to leave . poets such as ibn al-abbar and ibn amira mourned this exile from their beloved valencia . after the christian victory and the expulsion of the muslim population the city was divided between those who had participated in the conquest , according to the testimony in the llibre del repartiment ( book of distribution ) . james i granted the city new charters of law , the furs of valencia , which later were extended to the whole kingdom of valencia . thenceforth the city entered a new historical stage in which a new society and a new language developed , forming the basis of the character of the valencian people as they are known today .
iranian scientists outside iran have also made some major contributions to science . in 1960 , ali javan co-invented the first gas laser , and fuzzy set theory was introduced by lotfi zadeh . iranian cardiologist , tofy mussivand invented and developed the first artificial cardiac pump , the precursor of the artificial heart . furthering research and treatment of diabetes , hba1c was discovered by samuel rahbar . iranian physics is especially strong in string theory , with many papers being published in iran . iranian-american string theorist kamran vafa proposed the vafa-witten theorem together with edward witten . in august 2014 , maryam mirzakhani became the first-ever woman , as well as the first-ever iranian , to receive the fields medal , the highest prize in mathematics .
during the middle ages , the eritrea region was known as medri bahri ( " sea-land " ) . the name eritrea is derived from the ancient greek name for red sea ( ἐρυθρὰ θάλασσα erythra thalassa , based on the adjective ἐρυθρός erythros " red " ) . it was first formally adopted in 1890 , with the formation of italian eritrea ( colonia eritrea ) . the territory became the eritrea governorate within italian east africa in 1936 . eritrea was annexed by ethiopia in 1953 ( nominally within a federation until 1962 ) and an eritrean liberation front formed in 1960 . eritrea gained independence following the 1993 referendum , and the name of the new state was defined as state of eritrea in the 1997 constitution .

in past times , mending was an art . a meticulous tailor or seamstress could mend rips with thread raveled from hems and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible . when the raw material – cloth – was worth more than labor , it made sense to expend labor in saving it . today clothing is considered a consumable item . mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it . many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending . the thrifty still replace zippers and buttons and sew up ripped hems .
the first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910 ; however , decades later during the 1940s manufacturers began to produce large amounts of synthetic pesticides and their use became widespread . some sources consider the 1940s and 1950s to have been the start of the " pesticide era . " although the u.s. environmental protection agency was established in 1970 and amendments to the pesticide law in 1972 , pesticide use has increased 50-fold since 1950 and 2.3 million tonnes ( 2.5 million short tons ) of industrial pesticides are now [ when ? ] used each year . seventy-five percent of all pesticides in the world are used in developed countries , but use in developing countries is increasing . a study of usa pesticide use trends through 1997 was published in 2003 by the national science foundation 's center for integrated pest management .
ultimately , world war i created a decisive break with the old world order that had emerged after the napoleonic wars , which was modified by the mid-19th century 's nationalistic revolutions . the results of world war i would be important factors in the development of world war ii approximately 20 years later . more immediate to the time , the partitioning of the ottoman empire was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of west asia . the huge conglomeration of territories and peoples formerly ruled by the sultan of the ottoman empire was divided into several new nations . the partitioning brought the creation of the modern arab world and the republic of turkey . the league of nations granted france mandates over syria and lebanon and granted the united kingdom mandates over mesopotamia and palestine ( which was later divided into two regions : palestine and transjordan ) . parts of the ottoman empire on the arabian peninsula became parts of what are today saudi arabia and yemen .
expansive interior light has been a feature of gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened . the metaphysics of light in the middle ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings . much of this belief was based on the writings of pseudo-dionysius , a sixth-century mystic whose book , the celestial hierarchy , was popular among monks in france . pseudo-dionysius held that all light , even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows , was divine . to promote such faith , the abbot in charge of the saint-denis church on the north edge of paris , the abbot suger , encouraged architects remodeling the building to make the interior as bright as possible .
after years of negotiation , three great powers , russia , the united kingdom and france , decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to greece . following news that combined ottoman–egyptian fleets were going to attack the greek island of hydra , the allied fleet intercepted the ottoman–egyptian fleet at navarino . after a week-long standoff , a battle began which resulted in the destruction of the ottoman–egyptian fleet . a french expeditionary force was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the egyptian army from the peloponnese , while the greeks proceeded to the captured part of central greece by 1828 . as a result of years of negotiation , the nascent greek state was finally recognized under the london protocol in 1830 .
downtown area is home to historic neighborhoods and buildings such as the sir walter raleigh hotel built in the early 20th century , the restored city market , the fayetteville street downtown business district , which includes the pnc plaza and wells fargo capitol center buildings , as well as the north carolina museum of history , north carolina museum of natural sciences , north carolina state capitol , peace college , the raleigh city museum , raleigh convention center , shaw university , and st. augustine 's college . the neighborhoods in old raleigh include cameron park , boylan heights , country club hills , coley forest , five points , budleigh , glenwood-brooklyn , hayes barton historic district , moore square , mordecai , rosengarten park , belvidere park , woodcrest , and historic oakwood . in the 2000s , an effort by the downtown raleigh alliance was made to separate this area of the city into five smaller districts : fayetteville street , moore square , glenwood south , warehouse ( raleigh ) , and capital district ( raleigh ) . some of the names have become common place among locals such as the warehouse , fayetteville street , and glenwood south districts .
the rise of islam , based on both the qur'an and muhammad strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the mediterranean region . early islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion , and the process of ijtihad to find truth—in effect all philosophy was " political " as it had real implications for governance . this view was challenged by the " rationalist " mutazilite philosophers , who held a more hellenic view , reason above revelation , and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of islam ; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the caliphate . by the late ancient period , however , the " traditionalist " asharite view of islam had in general triumphed . according to the asharites , reason must be subordinate to the quran and the sunna .
west 's fourth studio album , 808s & heartbreak ( 2008 ) , marked an even more radical departure from his previous releases , largely abandoning rap and hip hop stylings in favor of a stark electropop sound composed of virtual synthesis , the roland tr-808 drum machine , and explicitly auto-tuned vocal tracks . drawing inspiration from artists such as gary numan , tj swan and boy george , and maintaining a " minimal but functional " approach towards the album 's studio production , west explored the electronic feel produced by auto-tune and utilized the sounds created by the 808 , manipulating its pitch to produce a distorted , electronic sound ; he then sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks . the album 's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums , lengthy strings , droning synthesizers , and somber piano , and drew comparisons to the work of 1980s post-punk and new wave groups , with west himself later confessing an affinity with british post-punk group joy division . rolling stone journalist matthew trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote in a 2012 article , " now that popular music has finally caught up to it , 808s & heartbreak has revealed itself to be kanye ’ s most vulnerable work , and perhaps his most brilliant . "
the licchavi era was followed by the malla era . rulers from tirhut , upon being attacked by muslims , fled north to the kathmandu valley . they intermarried with nepali royalty , and this led to the malla era . the early years of the malla era were turbulent , with raids and attacks from khas and turk muslims . there was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of kathmandu 's population , including the king abhaya malla . these disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the licchavi era ( such as mangriha and kailashkut bhawan ) , and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city . despite the initial hardships , kathmandu rose to prominence again and , during most of the malla era , dominated the trade between india and tibet . nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-himalayan trade .
over time , fidelity , dynamic and noise levels improved to the point that it was harder to tell the difference between a live performance in the studio and the recorded version . this was especially true after the invention of the variable reluctance magnetic pickup cartridge by general electric in the 1940s when high quality cuts were played on well-designed audio systems . the capehart radio/phonographs of the era with large diameter electrodynamic loudspeakers , though not ideal , demonstrated this quite well with " home recordings " readily available in the music stores for the public to buy .
it is very rare for top clubs to miss the competition , although it can happen in exceptional circumstances . defending holders manchester united did not enter the 1999–2000 fa cup , as they were already in the inaugural club world championship , with the club stating that entering both tournaments would overload their fixture schedule and make it more difficult to defend their champions league and premiership titles . the club claimed that they did not want to devalue the fa cup by fielding a weaker side . the move benefited united as they received a two-week break and won the 1999–2000 league title by an 18-point margin , although they did not progress past the group stage of the club world championship . the withdrawal from the fa cup , however , drew considerable criticism as this weakened the tournament 's prestige and sir alex ferguson later admitted his regret regarding their handling of the situation .
stressful life experiences may be a cause of memory loss as a person ages . glucocorticoids that are released during stress damage neurons that are located in the hippocampal region of the brain . therefore , the more stressful situations that someone encounters , the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on . the ca1 neurons found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of glutamate . this high level of extracellular glutamate allow calcium to enter nmda receptors which in return kills neurons . stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind . this directly relates to traumatic events in one 's past such as kidnappings , being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child .
a 2013 trans-genome study carried out by 30 geneticists , from 13 universities and academies , from 9 countries , assembling the largest data set available to date , for assessment of ashkenazi jewish genetic origins found no evidence of khazar origin among ashkenazi jews . " thus , analysis of ashkenazi jews together with a large sample from the region of the khazar khaganate corroborates the earlier results that ashkenazi jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the middle east and europe , that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other jewish populations , and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the caucasus region " , the authors concluded .

in 1824 , the french physicist françois arago formulated the existence of rotating magnetic fields , termed arago 's rotations , which , by manually turning switches on and off , walter baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive induction motor . in the 1880s , many inventors were trying to develop workable ac motors because ac 's advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on ac . the first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by galileo ferraris and nikola tesla , a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887 . in 1888 , the royal academy of science of turin published ferraris ' research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that " the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor . " in 1888 , tesla presented his paper a new system for alternating current motors and transformers to the aiee that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types : one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor , another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor , and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited dc supply to rotor winding . one of the patents tesla filed in 1887 , however , also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor . george westinghouse promptly bought tesla 's patents , employed tesla to develop them , and assigned c. f. scott to help tesla , tesla left for other pursuits in 1889 . the constant speed ac induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars but westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in telluride , colorado in 1891 . steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development , mikhail dolivo-dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890 . this type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications . however , he claimed that tesla 's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations , which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work . although westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893 , these early westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until b. g. lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor . the general electric company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891 . by 1896 , general electric and westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design , later called the squirrel-cage rotor . induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100 horsepower ( hp ) induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 hp motor in 1897 .
american idol employs a panel of judges who critique the contestants ' performances . the original judges were record producer and music manager randy jackson , pop singer and choreographer paula abdul and music executive and manager simon cowell . the judging panel for the most recent season consisted of country singer keith urban , singer and actress jennifer lopez , and jazz singer harry connick , jr . the show was originally hosted by radio personality ryan seacrest and comedian brian dunkleman , with seacrest continuing on for the rest of the seasons .
the raleigh parks and recreation department offers a wide variety of leisure opportunities at more than 150 sites throughout the city , which include : 8,100 acres ( 33 km2 ) of park land , 78 miles ( 126 km ) of greenway , 22 community centers , a bmx championship-caliber race track , 112 tennis courts among 25 locations , 5 public lakes , and 8 public aquatic facilities . the j. c. raulston arboretum , an 8-acre ( 32,000 m² ) arboretum and botanical garden in west raleigh administered by north carolina state university , maintains a year-round collection that is open daily to the public without charge .
in arabia , bahrain , which was referred to by the greeks as tylos , the centre of pearl trading , when nearchus came to discover it serving under alexander the great . the greek admiral nearchus is believed to have been the first of alexander 's commanders to visit these islands . it is not known whether bahrain was part of the seleucid empire , although the archaeological site at qalat al bahrain has been proposed as a seleucid base in the persian gulf . alexander had planned to settle the eastern shores of the persian gulf with greek colonists , and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged , tylos was very much part of the hellenised world : the language of the upper classes was greek ( although aramaic was in everyday use ) , while zeus was worshipped in the form of the arabian sun-god shams . tylos even became the site of greek athletic contests .
first recognized in 1900 by max planck , it was originally the proportionality constant between the minimal increment of energy , e , of a hypothetical electrically charged oscillator in a cavity that contained black body radiation , and the frequency , f , of its associated electromagnetic wave . in 1905 the value e , the minimal energy increment of a hypothetical oscillator , was theoretically associated by einstein with a " quantum " or minimal element of the energy of the electromagnetic wave itself . the light quantum behaved in some respects as an electrically neutral particle , as opposed to an electromagnetic wave . it was eventually called the photon .
the second digimon series is direct continuation of the first one , and began airing on april 2 , 2000 . three years later , with most of the original digidestined now in high school at age fourteen , the digital world was supposedly secure and peaceful . however , a new evil has appeared in the form of the digimon emperor ( digimon kaiser ) who as opposed to previous enemies is a human just like the digidestined . the digimon emperor has been enslaving digimon with dark rings and control spires and has somehow made regular digivolution impossible . however , five set digi-eggs with engraved emblems had been appointed to three new digidestined along with t.k . and kari , two of the digidestined from the previous series . this new evolutionary process , dubbed armor digivolution helps the new digidestined to defeat evil lurking in the digital world . eventually , the digidestined defeat the digimon emperor , more commonly known as ken ichijouji on earth , only with the great sacrifice of ken 's own digimon , wormmon . just when things were thought to be settled , new digimon enemies made from the deactivated control spires start to appear and cause trouble in the digital world . to atone for his past mistakes , ken joins the digidestined , being a digidestined himself , with his partner wormmon revived to fight against them . they soon save countries including france and australia from control spires and defeat malomyotismon ( belialvamdemon ) , the digivolved form of myotismon ( vamdemon ) from the previous series . they stop the evil from destroying the two worlds , and at the end , every person on earth gains their own digimon partner .
by 1990 , inspired by the fall of the berlin wall , a pro-democracy movement arose . pressure from the united states , france , and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called gibafor ( france , the usa , germany , japan , the eu , the world bank , and the un ) finally led kolingba to agree , in principle , to hold free elections in october 1992 with help from the un office of electoral affairs . after using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power , president kolingba came under intense pressure from gibafor to establish a " conseil national politique provisoire de la république " ( provisional national political council , cnppr ) and to set up a " mixed electoral commission " , which included representatives from all political parties .

in whitehead 's view , then , concepts such as " quality " , " matter " , and " form " are problematic . these " classical " concepts fail to adequately account for change , and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world . they are useful abstractions , but are not the world 's basic building blocks . what is ordinarily conceived of as a single person , for instance , is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events . after all , people change all the time , if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience . these occasions of experience are logically distinct , but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a " society " of events . by assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe , materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete ( what whitehead calls the " fallacy of misplaced concreteness " ) .
on october 1 , 1989 , a peaceful demonstration of 10,000 to 15,000 people was violently dispersed by the militia in front of lviv 's druzhba stadium , where a concert celebrating the soviet " reunification " of ukrainian lands was being held . on october 10 , ivano-frankivsk was the site of a pre-election protest attended by 30,000 people . on october 15 , several thousand people gathered in chervonohrad , chernivtsi , rivne , and zhytomyr ; 500 in dnipropetrovsk ; and 30,000 in lviv to protest the election law . on october 20 , faithful and clergy of the ukrainian autocephalous orthodox church participated in a synod in lviv , the first since its forced liquidation in the 1930s .
the mosaic pavement of the vrina plain basilica of butrint , albania appear to pre-date that of the baptistery by almost a generation , dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century . the mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures , birds , terrestrial beasts , fruits , flowers , trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of god ’ s creation . superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets , tabulae ansatae , carrying inscriptions . a variety of fish , a crab , a lobster , shrimps , mushrooms , flowers , a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions , which reads : in fulfilment of the vow ( prayer ) of those whose names god knows . this anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors ’ humility and an acknowledgement of god ’ s omniscience .
her mature artistic statement was visible in true blue ( 1986 ) and like a prayer ( 1989 ) . in true blue , she incorporated classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music . like a prayer introduced live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music , including dance , funk , r & b and gospel music . her versatility was further shown on i 'm breathless , which consists predominantly of the 1940s broadway showtune-flavoured jazz , swing and big band tracks . madonna continued to compose ballads and uptempo dance songs for erotica ( 1992 ) and bedtime stories ( 1994 ) . both albums explored element of new jack swing , with jim farber from entertainment weekly saying that " she could actually be viewed as new jack swing 's godmother . " she tried to remain contemporary by incorporating samples , drum loops and hip hop into her music . with ray of light , madonna brought electronic music from its underground status into massive popularity in mainstream music scene .
recent molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 million years ago and that modern families appeared in the period from the late eocene through the miocene . but paleontologists object that no placental fossils have been found from before the end of the cretaceous . the earliest undisputed fossils of placentals come from the early paleocene , after the extinction of the dinosaurs . in particular , scientists have recently identified an early paleocene animal named protungulatum donnae as one of the first placental mammals . the earliest known ancestor of primates is archicebus achilles from around 55 million years ago . this tiny primate weighed 20–30 grams ( 0.7–1.1 ounce ) and could fit within a human palm .
2010s saw multiple new sounds in house music developed by numerous djs . sweden knew a prominence of snare-less " swedish progressive house " with the emergence of sebastian ingrosso , axwell , steve angello ( these three formed a trio called swedish house mafia ) , avicii , alesso , etc . netherlands brought together a concept of " dirty dutch " , electro house subgenre characterized by very abrasive leads and darker arpeggios , with prominent djs chuckie , hardwell , laidback luke , afrojack , r3hab , bingo players , quintino , alvaro , cedric gervais , 2g , etc . elsewhere , fusion genres derivative of 2000s progressive house returned to prominence , especially with the help of djs calvin harris , eric prydz , mat zo , above & beyond and fonzerelli in europe , deadmau5 , kaskade , steve aoki , porter robinson and wolfgang gartner in the us and canada . the growing popularity of such artists led to the emergence of electro house and progressive house blended sounds in popular music , such as singles lady gaga 's " marry the night " , the black eyed peas ' " the best one yet ( the boy ) " and the will.i.am and britney spears " scream & shout " . big room house found increasing popularity since 2010 , particularly through international dance music festivals such as tomorrowland , ultra music festival , and electric daisy carnival .
byu offers programs in liberal arts , engineering , agriculture , management , physical and mathematical sciences , nursing and law . the university is broadly organized into 11 colleges or schools at its main provo campus , with certain colleges and divisions defining their own admission standards . the university also administers two satellite campuses , one in jerusalem and one in salt lake city , while its parent organization , the church educational system ( ces ) , sponsors sister schools in hawaii and idaho . the university 's primary focus is on undergraduate education , but it also has 68 master 's and 25 doctoral degree programs .
czech continued to evolve and gain in regional importance for hundreds of years , and has been a literary language in the slovak lands since the early fifteenth century . a biblical translation , the kralice bible , was published during the late sixteenth century ( around the time of the king james and luther versions ) which was more linguistically conservative than either . the publication of the kralice bible spawned widespread nationalism , and in 1615 the government of bohemia ruled that only czech-speaking residents would be allowed to become full citizens or inherit goods or land . this , and the conversion of the czech upper classes from the habsburg empire 's catholicism to protestantism , angered the habsburgs and helped trigger the thirty years ' war ( where the czechs were defeated at the battle of white mountain ) . the czechs became serfs ; bohemia 's printing industry ( and its linguistic and political rights ) were dismembered , removing official regulation and support from its language . german quickly became the dominant language in bohemia .
spectre has received mixed reviews , with many reviewers either giving the film highly positive or highly negative feedback . many critics praised the film 's opening scene , action sequences , stuntwork , cinematography and performances from the cast . in some early reviews , the film received favourable comparisons with its predecessor , skyfall . rotten tomatoes sampled 274 reviews and judged 64 % of the critiques to be positive , saying that the film " nudges daniel craig 's rebooted bond closer to the glorious , action-driven spectacle of earlier entries , although it 's admittedly reliant on established 007 formula . " on metacritic , the film has a rating of 60 out of 100 , based on 48 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of " a− " on an a+ to f scale .
the maurya empire ( 322–185 bce ) was the first empire to unify india into one state , and was the largest on the indian subcontinent . at its greatest extent , the mauryan empire stretched to the north up to the natural boundaries of the himalayas and to the east into what is now assam . to the west , it reached beyond modern pakistan , to the hindu kush mountains in what is now afghanistan . the empire was established by chandragupta maurya in magadha ( in modern bihar ) when he overthrew the nanda dynasty . chandragupta 's son bindusara succeeded to the throne around 297 bc . by the time he died in c. 272 bc , a large part of the subcontinent was under mauryan suzerainty . however , the region of kalinga ( around modern day odisha ) remained outside mauryan control , perhaps interfering with their trade with the south .
logan airport , located in east boston and operated by the massachusetts port authority ( massport ) , is boston 's principal airport . nearby general aviation airports are beverly municipal airport to the north , hanscom field to the west , and norwood memorial airport to the south . massport also operates several major facilities within the port of boston , including a cruise ship terminal and facilities to handle bulk and container cargo in south boston , and other facilities in charlestown and east boston .
chopin has figured extensively in polish literature , both in serious critical studies of his life and music and in fictional treatments . the earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on chopin by leon ulrich . french writers on chopin ( apart from sand ) have included marcel proust and andré gide ; and he has also featured in works of gottfried benn and boris pasternak . there are numerous biographies of chopin in english ( see bibliography for some of these ) .
the french army consisted in peacetime of approximately 400,000 soldiers , some of them regulars , others conscripts who until 1869 served the comparatively long period of seven years with the colours . some of them were veterans of previous french campaigns in the crimean war , algeria , the franco-austrian war in italy , and in the franco-mexican war . however , following the " seven weeks war " between prussia and austria four years earlier , it had been calculated that the french army could field only 288,000 men to face the prussian army when perhaps 1,000,000 would be required . under marshal adolphe niel , urgent reforms were made . universal conscription ( rather than by ballot , as previously ) and a shorter period of service gave increased numbers of reservists , who would swell the army to a planned strength of 800,000 on mobilisation . those who for any reason were not conscripted were to be enrolled in the garde mobile , a militia with a nominal strength of 400,000 . however , the franco-prussian war broke out before these reforms could be completely implemented . the mobilisation of reservists was chaotic and resulted in large numbers of stragglers , while the garde mobile were generally untrained and often mutinous .
the term hokkien ( 福建 ; hɔk˥˥kɪɛn˨˩ ) is itself a term not used in chinese to refer to the dialect , as it simply means fujian province . in chinese linguistics , these dialects are known by their classification under the quanzhang division ( chinese : 泉漳片 ; pinyin : quánzhāng piàn ) of min nan , which comes from the first characters of the two main hokkien urban centers quanzhou and zhangzhou . the variety is also known by other terms such as the more general min nan ( traditional chinese : 閩南語 , 閩南話 ; simplified chinese : 闽南语 , 闽南话 ; pinyin : mǐnnányǔ , mǐnnánhuà ; pe̍h-ōe-jī : bân-lâm-gí , bân-lâm-oē ) or southern min , and fulaohua ( traditional chinese : 福佬話 ; simplified chinese : 福佬话 ; pinyin : fúlǎohuà ; pe̍h-ōe-jī : hō-ló-oē ) . the term hokkien ( chinese : 福建話 ; pe̍h-ōe-jī : hok-kiàn oē ; tâi-lô : hok-kiàn-uē ) , on the other hand , is used commonly in south east asia to refer to min-nan dialects .
the most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships . parents ( often fathers ) are reluctant , absent or ignorant . peter banning in hook starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children . the notable absence of elliott 's father in e.t. , is the most famous example of this theme . in indiana jones and the last crusade , it is revealed that indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father , who is a professor of medieval literature , as his father always seemed more interested in his work , specifically in his studies of the holy grail , than in his own son , although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on indy ( he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son " self reliance , " which is not how indy saw it ) . even oskar schindler , from schindler 's list , is reluctant to have a child with his wife . munich depicts avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter . there are of course exceptions ; brody in jaws is a committed family man , while john anderton in minority report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son . this theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of spielberg 's films , since spielberg himself was affected by his parents ' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father . furthermore , to this theme , protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents , most notably e.t . the extra-terrestrial ( protagonist elliot 's mother is divorced ) and catch me if you can ( frank abagnale 's mother and father split early on in the film ) . little known also is tim in jurassic park ( early in the film , another secondary character mentions tim and lex 's parents ' divorce ) . the family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well . following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures , tim looks to dr. alan grant as a father figure . initially , dr. grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to tim . however , by the end of the film , he has changed , and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders .
capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor equation in a number of ways . some of these , such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear , or can be assumed to be linear , and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor . the usual methods of network analysis can then be applied . in other cases , such as with breakdown voltage , the effect is non-linear and normal ( i.e. , linear ) network analysis can not be used , the effect must be dealt with separately . there is yet another group , which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant . such an example is temperature dependence . finally , combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance , resistance , or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation .
when ibn sina was 22 years old , he lost his father . the samanid dynasty came to its end in december 1004 . ibn sina seems to have declined the offers of mahmud of ghazni , and proceeded westwards to urgench in modern turkmenistan , where the vizier , regarded as a friend of scholars , gave him a small monthly stipend . the pay was small , however , so ibn sina wandered from place to place through the districts of nishapur and merv to the borders of khorasan , seeking an opening for his talents . qabus , the generous ruler of tabaristan , himself a poet and a scholar , with whom ibn sina had expected to find asylum , was on about that date ( 1012 ) starved to death by his troops who had revolted . ibn sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness . finally , at gorgan , near the caspian sea , ibn sina met with a friend , who bought a dwelling near his own house in which ibn sina lectured on logic and astronomy . several of ibn sina 's treatises were written for this patron ; and the commencement of his canon of medicine also dates from his stay in hyrcania .
homer uses the terms achaeans and danaans ( δαναοί ) as a generic term for greeks in iliad , and they were probably a part of the mycenean civilization . the names achaioi and danaoi seem to be pre-dorian belonging to the people who were overthrown . they were forced to the region that later bore the name achaea after the dorian invasion . in the 5th century bc , they were redefined as contemporary speakers of aeolic greek which was spoken mainly in thessaly , boeotia and lesbos . there are many controversial theories on the origin of the achaeans . according to one view , the achaeans were one of the fair-headed tribes of upper europe , who pressed down over the alps during the early iron age ( 1300 bc ) to southern europe . another theory suggests that the peloponnesian dorians were the achaeans . these theories are rejected by other scholars who , based on linguistic criteria , suggest that the achaeans were mainland pre-dorian greeks . there is also the theory that there was an achaean ethnos that migrated from asia minor to lower thessaly prior to 2000 bc . some hittite texts mention a nation lying to the west called ahhiyava or ahhiya . egyptian documents refer to ekwesh , one of the groups of sea peoples who attached egypt during the reign of merneptah ( 1213-1203 bce ) , who may have been achaeans .
thomas davidson taught a philosophy called " apeirotheism " , a " form of pluralistic idealism ... coupled with a stern ethical rigorism " which he defined as " a theory of gods infinite in number . " the theory was indebted to aristotle 's pluralism and his concepts of soul , the rational , living aspect of a living substance which can not exist apart from the body because it is not a substance but an essence , and nous , rational thought , reflection and understanding . although a perennial source of controversy , aristotle arguably views the latter as both eternal and immaterial in nature , as exemplified in his theology of unmoved movers . identifying aristotle 's god with rational thought , davidson argued , contrary to aristotle , that just as the soul can not exist apart from the body , god can not exist apart from the world .
four boarders at his parents ' apartments became chopin 's intimates : tytus woyciechowski , jan nepomucen białobłocki , jan matuszyński and julian fontana ; the latter two would become part of his paris milieu . he was friendly with members of warsaw 's young artistic and intellectual world , including fontana , józef bohdan zaleski and stefan witwicki . he was also attracted to the singing student konstancja gładkowska . in letters to woyciechowski , he indicated which of his works , and even which of their passages , were influenced by his fascination with her ; his letter of 15 may 1830 revealed that the slow movement ( larghetto ) of his piano concerto no . 1 ( in e minor ) was secretly dedicated to her – " it should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime – by moonlight . " his final conservatory report ( july 1829 ) read : " chopin f. , third-year student , exceptional talent , musical genius . "
this first list is referred to as the " class of '67 " in the endangered species act at thirty , volume 1 , which concludes that habitat destruction , the biggest threat to those 78 species , is still the same threat to the currently listed species . it included only vertebrates because the department of interior 's definition of " fish and wildlife " was limited to vertebrates . however , with time , researchers noticed that the animals on the endangered species list still were not getting enough protection , thus further threatening their extinction . the endangered species program was expanded by the endangered species act of 1969 .
the " soft " ac format has reinvented in the late 2000s/early 2010s as a result of its declining relevance , adopting a more upmarket , middle-of-the-road approach , with a selection of " oldies " ( usually from the 1960s/70s onwards ) , primarily rock , jazz , r & b and pop music . newer songs are more often ( but not limited to ) " easy listening " fare , this amount varying depending on the age of the station 's target demographic .
alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting , and about 2000 years after " natural bronze " had come into general use [ citation needed ] . bronze artifacts from the vinča culture date to 4500 bc . sumerian and egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 bc . the bronze age began in southeastern europe around 3700–3300 bc , in northwestern europe about 2500 bc . it ended with the beginning of the iron age , 2000–1000 bc in the near east , 600 bc in northern europe . the transition between the neolithic period and the bronze age was formerly termed the chalcolithic period ( copper-stone ) , with copper tools being used with stone tools . this term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the chalcolithic and neolithic are coterminous at both ends . brass , an alloy of copper and zinc , is of much more recent origin . it was known to the greeks , but became a significant supplement to bronze during the roman empire .
prior to planck 's work , it had been assumed that the energy of a body could take on any value whatsoever – that it was a continuous variable . the rayleigh–jeans law makes close predictions for a narrow range of values at one limit of temperatures , but the results diverge more and more strongly as temperatures increase . to make planck 's law , which correctly predicts blackbody emissions , it was necessary to multiply the classical expression by a complex factor that involves h in both the numerator and the denominator . the influence of h in this complex factor would not disappear if it were set to zero or to any other value . making an equation out of planck 's law that would reproduce the rayleigh–jeans law could not be done by changing the values of h , of the boltzmann constant , or of any other constant or variable in the equation . in this case the picture given by classical physics is not duplicated by a range of results in the quantum picture .
in theravada buddhism there can be no divine salvation or forgiveness for one 's karma , since it is a purely impersonal process that is a part of the makeup of the universe . [ citation needed ] in mahayana buddhism , the texts of certain mahayana sutras ( such as the lotus sutra , the aṅgulimālīya sūtra and the mahāyāna mahāparinirvāṇa sūtra ) claim that the recitation or merely the hearing of their texts can expunge great swathes of negative karma . some forms of buddhism ( for example , vajrayana ) regard the recitation of mantras as a means for cutting off of previous negative karma . the japanese pure land teacher genshin taught that amitābha has the power to destroy the karma that would otherwise bind one in saṃsāra .
the name ashkenazi derives from the biblical figure of ashkenaz , the first son of gomer , son of khaphet , son of noah , and a japhetic patriarch in the table of nations ( genesis 10 ) . the name of gomer has often been linked to the ethnonym cimmerians . biblical ashkenaz is usually derived from assyrian aškūza ( cuneiform aškuzai/iškuzai ) , a people who expelled the cimmerians from the armenian area of the upper euphrates , whose name is usually associated with the name of the scythians . the intrusive n in the biblical name is likely due to a scribal error confusing a waw ו with a nun נ .

the west balkan coast was inhabited by various illyrian tribes and kingdoms such as the kingdom of the dalmatae and of the ardiaei , who often engaged in piracy under queen teuta ( reigned 231 bc to 227 bce ) . further inland was the illyrian paeonian kingdom and the tribe of the agrianes which covers most of the modern republic of macedonia . illyrians on the coast of the adriatic were under the effects and influence of hellenisation and some tribes adopted greek , becoming bilingual due to their proximity to the greek colonies in illyria . illyrians imported weapons and armor from the ancient greeks ( such as the illyrian type helmet , originally a greek type ) and also adopted the ornamentation of ancient macedon on their shields and their war belts ( a single one has been found , dated 3rd century bc at modern selce e poshtme part of macedon at the time under philip v of macedon ) .

in 1855 a reprint of a letter earlier sent to the times appeared in littel 's living age . its author , an " official chinese interpreter of 10 years ' active service " and a member of the oriental club , thomas taylor meadows , was replying to the suggestion by another interpreter that the british empire was wasting its resources on a false threat from russia against china . toward the end of the letter he said :
the transat ag2r race , held every alternate year , is an event which originates in concarneau in brittany , france , reaching st. barthélemy . it is a boat race with boats of 10 m length with a single hull and with essential safety equipment . each boat is navigated by two sailors . kitesurfing and other water sports have also become popular on the island in recent years , especially at grand cul-de-sac beach ( baie de grand cul de sac ) for windy sports as kitesurfing and saint jean beach ( baie de saint jean ) , lorient , toiny and anse des cayes for surfing . tennis is also popular on the island and it has several tennis clubs , tennis clube de flamboyant in grand cul-de-sac , ajoe tennis club in orient and asco in colombier .
occasional severe flooding is experienced . there was the great mississippi flood of 1927 , the great flood of 1993 , and widespread flooding and mudslides caused by the 1982-1983 el niño event in the western united states . localized flooding can , however , occur anywhere , and mudslides from heavy rain can cause problems in any mountainous area , particularly the southwest . large stretches of desert shrub in the west can fuel the spread of wildfires . the narrow canyons of many mountain areas in the west and severe thunderstorm activity during the summer lead to sometimes devastating flash floods as well , while nor'easter snowstorms can bring activity to a halt throughout the northeast ( although heavy snowstorms can occur almost anywhere ) .
many of the city 's buildings are in the georgian style , although there are a number of examples of modern landmark structures , such as county hall tower , which was , at one time the tallest building in ireland until being superseded by another cork city building : the elysian . across the river from county hall is ireland 's longest building ; built in victorian times , our lady 's psychiatric hospital has now been renovated and converted into a residential housing complex called atkins hall , after its architect william atkins .
chthonic gods such as dis pater , the di inferi ( " gods below " ) , and the collective shades of the departed ( di manes ) were given dark , fertile victims in nighttime rituals . animal sacrifice usually took the form of a holocaust or burnt offering , and there was no shared banquet , as " the living can not share a meal with the dead " . ceres and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals ; tellus was given a pregnant cow at the fordicidia festival . color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices . demigods and heroes , who belonged to the heavens and the underworld , were sometimes given black-and-white victims . robigo ( or robigus ) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the robigalia for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew .
for example , the full name of oda nobunaga would be " oda kazusanosuke saburo nobunaga " ( 織田上総介三郎信長 ) , in which " oda " is a clan or family name , " kazusanosuke " is a title of vice-governor of kazusa province , " saburo " is a formal nickname ( yobina ) , and " nobunaga " is an adult name ( nanori ) given at genpuku , the coming of age ceremony . a man was addressed by his family name and his title , or by his yobina if he did not have a title . however , the nanori was a private name that could be used by only a very few , including the emperor .
even non-theist views about gods vary . some non-theists avoid the concept of god , whilst accepting that it is significant to many ; other non-theists understand god as a symbol of human values and aspirations . the nineteenth-century english atheist charles bradlaugh declared that he refused to say " there is no god " , because " the word 'god ' is to me a sound conveying no clear or distinct affirmation " ; he said more specifically that he disbelieved in the christian god . stephen jay gould proposed an approach dividing the world of philosophy into what he called " non-overlapping magisteria " ( noma ) . in this view , questions of the supernatural , such as those relating to the existence and nature of god , are non-empirical and are the proper domain of theology . the methods of science should then be used to answer any empirical question about the natural world , and theology should be used to answer questions about ultimate meaning and moral value . in this view , the perceived lack of any empirical footprint from the magisterium of the supernatural onto natural events makes science the sole player in the natural world .
in the spring of 1834 , chopin attended the lower rhenish music festival in aix-la-chapelle with hiller , and it was there that chopin met felix mendelssohn . after the festival , the three visited düsseldorf , where mendelssohn had been appointed musical director . they spent what mendelssohn described as " a very agreeable day " , playing and discussing music at his piano , and met friedrich wilhelm schadow , director of the academy of art , and some of his eminent pupils such as lessing , bendemann , hildebrandt and sohn . in 1835 chopin went to carlsbad , where he spent time with his parents ; it was the last time he would see them . on his way back to paris , he met old friends from warsaw , the wodzińskis . he had made the acquaintance of their daughter maria in poland five years earlier , when she was eleven . this meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in dresden , when he had previously intended to return to paris via leipzig . the sixteen-year-old girl 's portrait of the composer is considered , along with delacroix 's , as among chopin 's best likenesses . in october he finally reached leipzig , where he met schumann , clara wieck and felix mendelssohn , who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio st. paul , and who considered him " a perfect musician " . in july 1836 chopin travelled to marienbad and dresden to be with the wodziński family , and in september he proposed to maria , whose mother countess wodzińska approved in principle . chopin went on to leipzig , where he presented schumann with his g minor ballade . at the end of 1836 he sent maria an album in which his sister ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs , and his 1835 nocturne in c-sharp minor , op . 27 , no . 1 . the anodyne thanks he received from maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her .
in may and june 1835 , the area which is now central and northern melbourne was explored by john batman , a leading member of the port phillip association in van diemen 's land ( now known as tasmania ) , who claimed to have negotiated a purchase of 600,000 acres ( 2,400 km2 ) with eight wurundjeri elders . batman selected a site on the northern bank of the yarra river , declaring that " this will be the place for a village " . batman then returned to launceston in tasmania . in early august 1835 a different group of settlers , including john pascoe fawkner , left launceston on the ship enterprize . fawkner was forced to disembark at georgetown , tasmania , because of outstanding debts . the remainder of the party continued and arrived at the mouth of the yarra river on 15 august 1835 . on 30 august 1835 the party disembarked and established a settlement at the site of the current melbourne immigration museum . batman and his group arrived on 2 september 1835 and the two groups ultimately agreed to share the settlement .
as charles town grew , so did the community 's cultural and social opportunities , especially for the elite merchants and planters . the first theatre building in america was built in 1736 on the site of today 's dock street theatre . benevolent societies were formed by different ethnic groups , from french huguenots to free people of color to germans to jews . the charles towne library society was established in 1748 by well-born young men who wanted to share the financial cost to keep up with the scientific and philosophical issues of the day . this group also helped establish the college of charles towne in 1770 , the oldest college in south carolina . until its transition to state ownership in 1970 , this was the oldest municipally supported college in the united states .
john 's personal life greatly affected his reign . contemporary chroniclers state that john was sinfully lustful and lacking in piety . it was common for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses , but chroniclers complained that john 's mistresses were married noblewomen , which was considered unacceptable . john had at least five children with mistresses during his first marriage to isabelle of gloucester , and two of those mistresses are known to have been noblewomen . john 's behaviour after his second marriage to isabella of angoulême is less clear , however . none of john 's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried , and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point , although john certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period . the specific accusations made against john during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt ; nonetheless , most of john 's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour .

to popper , who was an anti-justificationist , traditional philosophy is misled by the false principle of sufficient reason . he thinks that no assumption can ever be or needs ever to be justified , so a lack of justification is not a justification for doubt . instead , theories should be tested and scrutinised . it is not the goal to bless theories with claims of certainty or justification , but to eliminate errors in them . he writes , " there are no such things as good positive reasons ; nor do we need such things [ ... ] but [ philosophers ] obviously can not quite bring [ themselves ] to believe that this is my opinion , let alone that it is right " ( the philosophy of karl popper , p. 1043 )
during this time , link also helps midna find the fused shadows , fragments of a relic containing powerful dark magic . in return , she helps link find ordon village 's children while helping the monkeys of faron , the gorons of eldin , and the zoras of lanayru . once link has restored the light spirits and midna has all the fused shadows , they are ambushed by zant . after he relieves midna of the fused shadow fragments , she ridicules him for abusing his tribe 's magic , but zant reveals that his power comes from another source as he uses it to turn link back into a wolf , and then leaves midna in hyrule to die from the world 's light . bringing a dying midna to zelda , link learns he needs the master sword to return to human form . zelda sacrifices herself to heal midna with her power before vanishing mysteriously . midna is moved by zelda 's sacrifice , and begins to care more about link and the fate of the light world .
ganondorf then revives , and midna teleports link and zelda outside the castle so she can hold him off with the fused shadows . however , as hyrule castle collapses , it is revealed that ganondorf was victorious as he crushes midna 's helmet . ganondorf engages link on horseback , and , assisted by zelda and the light spirits , link eventually knocks ganondorf off his horse and they duel on foot before link strikes down ganondorf and plunges the master sword into his chest . with ganondorf dead , the light spirits not only bring midna back to life , but restore her to her true form . after bidding farewell to link and zelda , midna returns home before destroying the mirror of twilight with a tear to maintain balance between hyrule and the twilight realm . near the end , as hyrule castle is rebuilt , link is shown leaving ordon village heading to parts unknown .
the primary responsibility for a boy 's studies lies with his house master , but he is assisted by an additional director of studies , known as a tutor . classes , colloquially known as " divs " ( divisions ) , are organised on a school basis ; the classrooms are separate from the houses . new school buildings have appeared for teaching purposes every decade or so since new schools , designed by henry woodyer and built 1861-3 . despite the introduction of modern technology , the external appearance and locations of many of the classrooms have remained unchanged for a long time .
there are also three deputy chiefs of the defence staff with particular remits , deputy chief of the defence staff ( capability ) , deputy cds ( personnel and training ) and deputy cds ( operations ) . the surgeon general , represents the defence medical services on the defence staff , and is the clinical head of that service .
tajikistan 's economy grew substantially after the war . the gdp of tajikistan expanded at an average rate of 9.6 % over the period of 2000–2007 according to the world bank data . this improved tajikistan 's position among other central asian countries ( namely turkmenistan and uzbekistan ) , which seem to have degraded economically ever since . the primary sources of income in tajikistan are aluminium production , cotton growing and remittances from migrant workers . cotton accounts for 60 % of agricultural output , supporting 75 % of the rural population , and using 45 % of irrigated arable land . the aluminium industry is represented by the state-owned tajik aluminum company – the biggest aluminium plant in central asia and one of the biggest in the world .
in late december , barcelona 's appeal to the court of arbitration for sport was unsuccessful and the original transfer ban was reinstated , leaving the club unable to utilise the 2015 winter and summer transfer windows . on 5 january 2015 , zubizareta was sacked by the board after 4 years as director of football . the next month , barcelona announced the formation of a new football area technical commission , made up of vice-president jordi mestre , board member javier bordas , carles rexach and ariedo braida .
the central oscillator generates a self-sustaining rhythm and is driven by two interacting feedback loops that are active at different times of day . the morning loop consists of cca1 ( circadian and clock-associated 1 ) and lhy ( late elongated hypocotyl ) , which encode closely related myb transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in arabidopsis , as well as prr 7 and 9 ( pseudo-response regulators . ) the evening loop consists of gi ( gigantea ) and elf4 , both involved in regulation of flowering time genes . when cca1 and lhy are overexpressed ( under constant light or dark conditions ) , plants become arrhythmic , and mrna signals reduce , contributing to a negative feedback loop . gene expression of cca1 and lhy oscillates and peaks in the early morning , whereas toc1 gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening . while it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed cca1 and lhy repress toc1 and over-expressed toc1 is a positive regulator of cca1 and lhy , it was shown in 2012 by andrew millar and others that toc1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of cca1 , lhy , and prr7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of gi and elf4 in the evening loop . this finding and further computational modeling of toc1 gene functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component repressilator model rather than the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals .
phonology also includes topics such as phonotactics ( the phonological constraints on what sounds can appear in what positions in a given language ) and phonological alternation ( how the pronunciation of a sound changes through the application of phonological rules , sometimes in a given order which can be feeding or bleeding , ) as well as prosody , the study of suprasegmentals and topics such as stress and intonation .
the bronx is named after jonas bronck who created the first settlement as part of the new netherland colony in 1639 . the native lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers . in the 19th and 20th centuries , the bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community , first from various european countries ( particularly ireland , germany and italy ) and later from the caribbean region ( particularly puerto rico , jamaica and the dominican republic ) , as well as african american migrants from the american south . this cultural mix has made the bronx a wellspring of both latin music and hip hop .
times atlases have been produced since 1895 . they are currently produced by the collins bartholomew imprint of harpercollins publishers . the flagship product is the times comprehensive atlas of the world .
wu chinese has a three-way distinction in stops and affricates : /p pʰ b/ . in addition to aspirated and unaspirated consonants , there is a series of muddy consonants , like /b/ . these are pronounced with slack or breathy voice : that is , they are weakly voiced . muddy consonants as initial cause a syllable to be pronounced with low pitch or light ( 陽 yáng ) tone .
some paleontologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier than the cambrian explosion , possibly as early as 1 billion years ago . trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the tonian period indicate the presence of triploblastic worms , like metazoans , roughly as large ( about 5 mm wide ) and complex as earthworms . during the beginning of the tonian period around 1 billion years ago , there was a decrease in stromatolite diversity , which may indicate the appearance of grazing animals , since stromatolite diversity increased when grazing animals went extinct at the end permian and end ordovician extinction events , and decreased shortly after the grazer populations recovered . however the discovery that tracks very similar to these early trace fossils are produced today by the giant single-celled protist gromia sphaerica casts doubt on their interpretation as evidence of early animal evolution .
by 1860 , houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton . railroad spurs from the texas inland converged in houston , where they met rail lines to the ports of galveston and beaumont . during the american civil war , houston served as a headquarters for general john bankhead magruder , who used the city as an organization point for the battle of galveston . after the civil war , houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city 's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of galveston . by 1890 , houston was the railroad center of texas .
j. edgar hoover served as director from 1924 to 1972 , a combined 48 years with the boi , doi , and fbi . he was chiefly responsible for creating the scientific crime detection laboratory , or the fbi laboratory , which officially opened in 1932 , as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government . hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the fbi handled during his tenure . after hoover 's death , congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future fbi directors to ten years .
federal law originates with the constitution , which gives congress the power to enact statutes for certain limited purposes like regulating interstate commerce . the united states code is the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes . many statutes give executive branch agencies the power to create regulations , which are published in the federal register and codified into the code of federal regulations . regulations generally also carry the force of law under the chevron doctrine . many lawsuits turn on the meaning of a federal statute or regulation , and judicial interpretations of such meaning carry legal force under the principle of stare decisis .
because of the distance of neptune from earth , its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4 arcseconds , the smallest of the solar system planets . its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually . most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of hubble space telescope ( hst ) and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics ( ao ) . the first scientifically useful observation of neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics , was commenced in 1997 from hawaii . neptune is currently entering its spring and summer season and has been shown to be heating up , with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence . combined with technological advancements , ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of this outer planet . both the hst and ao telescopes on earth has made many new discoveries within the solar system since the mid-1990s , with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planets for example . in 2004 and 2005 , five new small satellites of neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered .
older or stripped-down systems may support only the tz values required by posix , which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value . for example , tz='est5edt , m3.2.0/02:00 , m11.1.0/02:00 ' specifies time for the eastern united states starting in 2007 . such a tz value must be changed whenever dst rules change , and the new value applies to all years , mishandling some older timestamps .
the bibliothèque nationale et universitaire ( bnu ) is , with its collection of more than 3,000,000 titles , the second largest library in france after the bibliothèque nationale de france . it was founded by the german administration after the complete destruction of the previous municipal library in 1871 and holds the unique status of being simultaneously a students ' and a national library . the strasbourg municipal library had been marked erroneously as " city hall " in a french commercial map , which had been captured and used by the german artillery to lay their guns . a librarian from munich later pointed out " ... that the destruction of the precious collection was not the fault of a german artillery officer , who used the french map , but of the slovenly and inaccurate scholarship of a frenchman . "
another great undertaking by constantine monomachos was the restoration of the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem between 1042 and 1048 . nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the russian abbot daniel , who visited jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description : " lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling , over the tribune . the altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of christ . in the main altar one can see the mosaic of the exhaltation of adam . in the apse the ascension of christ . the annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar . "
many types of sports equipment are made of wood , or were constructed of wood in the past . for example , cricket bats are typically made of white willow . the baseball bats which are legal for use in major league baseball are frequently made of ash wood or hickory , and in recent years have been constructed from maple even though that wood is somewhat more fragile . nba courts have been traditionally made out of parquetry .
moreover , a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients , combined with a global glut in investment capital , led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets . professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management . there is , therefore , an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation . as the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline , asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients . many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced ( under-yielding ) investments , to the detriment of their clients , in order to maintain their assets under management . this choice was supported by a " plausible deniability " of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early " vintages " of subprime loans was so low .
the most excellent order of the british empire is the " order of chivalry of british constitutional monarchy " , rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences , work with charitable and welfare organisations and public service outside the civil service . it was established on 4 june 1917 by king george v , and comprises five classes , in civil and military divisions , the most senior two of which make the recipient either a knight if male , or dame if female . there is also the related british empire medal , whose recipients are affiliated with , but not members of , the order .
the original post-punk movement ended as the bands associated with the movement turned away from its aesthetics , often in favor of more commercial sounds . many of these groups would continue recording as part of the new pop movement , with entryism becoming a popular concept . in the united states , driven by mtv and modern rock radio stations , a number of post-punk acts had an influence on or became part of the second british invasion of " new music " there . some shifted to a more commercial new wave sound ( such as gang of four ) , while others were fixtures on american college radio and became early examples of alternative rock . perhaps the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was u2 , who combined elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music .
though brazilians of at least partial african heritage make up a large percentage of the population , few blacks have been elected as politicians . the city of salvador , bahia , for instance , is 80 % people of color , but voters have not elected a mayor of color . journalists like to say that us cities with black majorities , such as detroit and new orleans , have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement , when the voting rights act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities , and blacks in the south regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century . new orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s . new orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of hurricane katrina in 2005 .
in congregational and presbyterian churches which profess a traditionally calvinist or reformed theology there are differing views regarding present-day continuation or cessation of the gifts ( charismata ) of the spirit . generally , however , reformed charismatics distance themselves from renewal movements with tendencies which could be perceived as overemotional , such as word of faith , toronto blessing , brownsville revival and lakeland revival . prominent reformed charismatic denominations are the sovereign grace churches and the every nation churches in the usa , in great britain there is the newfrontiers churches and movement , which leading figure is terry virgo .
lancashire emerged as a major commercial and industrial region during the industrial revolution . manchester and liverpool grew into its largest cities , dominating global trade and the birth of modern capitalism . the county contained several mill towns and the collieries of the lancashire coalfield . by the 1830s , approximately 85 % of all cotton manufactured worldwide was processed in lancashire . accrington , blackburn , bolton , burnley , bury , chorley , colne , darwen , nelson , oldham , preston , rochdale and wigan were major cotton mill towns during this time . blackpool was a centre for tourism for the inhabitants of lancashire 's mill towns , particularly during wakes week .
after world war ii , eastern european countries such as the soviet union , poland , czechoslovakia , hungary , romania and yugoslavia expelled the germans from their territories . many of those had inhabited these lands for centuries , developing a unique culture . germans were also forced to leave the former eastern territories of germany , which were annexed by poland ( silesia , pomerania , parts of brandenburg and southern part of east prussia ) and the soviet union ( northern part of east prussia ) . between 12 and 16,5 million ethnic germans and german citizens were expelled westwards to allied-occupied germany .
the first game in arena football league history was played on june 19 , 1987 , between the gladiators and commandos at pittsburgh civic arena in front of 12,117 fans . the game was deliberately not televised so that it could be analyzed and any follies and failures would not be subject to national public scrutiny . following the inaugural game , tweaks and adjustments were made , and the first season continued . the dynamite and bruisers played in the first-ever televised afl game the next night , on june 20 , 1987 , at the rosemont horizon in suburban chicago on espn with bob rathbun and lee corso calling the play . the broadcast showed a short clip of the commandos-gladiators game . each team played six games , two against each other team . the top two teams , denver and pittsburgh , then competed in the first-ever afl championship game , arenabowl i .
in the human digestive system , food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication ( chewing ) , a form of mechanical digestion , and the wetting contact of saliva . saliva , a liquid secreted by the salivary glands , contains salivary amylase , an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food ; the saliva also contains mucus , which lubricates the food , and hydrogen carbonate , which provides the ideal conditions of ph ( alkaline ) for amylase to work . after undergoing mastication and starch digestion , the food will be in the form of a small , round slurry mass called a bolus . it will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis . gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion . gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin . as these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall , mucus is secreted by the stomach , providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals . at the same time protein digestion is occurring , mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis , which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall . this allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes .
the beijing olympic organizing committee sent out a team of 30 unarmed attendants selected from the people 's armed police to escort the flame throughout its journey . according to asian times , sworn in as the " beijing olympic games sacred flame protection unit " during a ceremony in august 2007 , their main job is to keep the olympic flame alight throughout the journey and to assist in transferring the flame between the torches , the lanterns and the cauldrons . they wear matching blue tracksuits and are intended to accompany the torch every step of the way . one of the torch attendants , dubbed " second right brother , " has developed a significant online fan-base , particularly among china 's female netizens .
in 2010 and 2011 , state and federal funds were awarded to connecticut ( and massachusetts ) to construct the hartford line , with a southern terminus at new haven 's union station and a northern terminus at springfield 's union station . according to the white house , " this corridor [ currently ] has one train per day connecting communities in connecticut and massachusetts to the northeast corridor and vermont . the vision for this corridor is to restore the alignment to its original route via the knowledge corridor in western massachusetts , improving trip time and increasing the population base that can be served . " set for construction in 2013 , the " knowledge corridor high speed intercity passenger rail " project will cost approximately $ 1 billion , and the ultimate northern terminus for the project is reported to be montreal in canada . train speeds between will reportedly exceed 110 miles per hour ( 180 km/h ) and increase both cities ' rail traffic exponentially .
the foundation of northwestern university is traceable to a meeting on may 31 , 1850 of nine prominent chicago businessmen , methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once been known as the northwest territory . on january 28 , 1851 , the illinois general assembly granted a charter to the trustees of the north-western university , making it the first chartered university in illinois . the school 's nine founders , all of whom were methodists ( three of them ministers ) , knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting . although they affiliated the university with the methodist episcopal church , they were committed to non-sectarian admissions , believing that northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory .
the city is home to new haven promise , a scholarship funded by yale university for students who meet the requirements . students must be enrolled in a public high school ( charters included ) for four years , be a resident of the city during that time , carry a 3.0 cumulative grade-point average , have a 90-percent attendance rate and perform 40 hours of service to the city . the initiative was launched in 2010 and there are currently more than 500 scholars enrolled in qualifying connecticut colleges and universities . there are more than 60 cities in the country that have a promise-type program for their students .
many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested , with varying weight assigned by experts . the u.s. senate 's levin–coburn report concluded that the crisis was the result of " high risk , complex financial products ; undisclosed conflicts of interest ; the failure of regulators , the credit rating agencies , and the market itself to rein in the excesses of wall street . " the financial crisis inquiry commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by " widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision " , " dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions " , " a combination of excessive borrowing , risky investments , and lack of transparency " by financial institutions , ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that " added to the uncertainty and panic " , a " systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics " , " collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline " , deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives , especially credit default swaps , and " the failures of credit rating agencies " to correctly price risk . the 1999 repeal of the glass-steagall act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the united states . critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products , and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets . research into the causes of the financial crisis has also focused on the role of interest rate spreads .
despite being an original story , spectre draws on ian fleming 's source material , most notably in the character of franz oberhauser , played by christoph waltz . oberhauser shares his name with hannes oberhauser , a background character in the short story " octopussy " from the octopussy and the living daylights collection , and who is named in the film as having been a temporary legal guardian of a young bond in 1983 . similarly , charmian bond is shown to have been his full-time guardian , observing the back story established by fleming . with the acquisition of the rights to spectre and its associated characters , screenwriters neal purvis and robert wade revealed that the film would provide a minor retcon to the continuity of the previous films , with the quantum organisation alluded to in casino royale and introduced in quantum of solace reimagined as a division within spectre rather than an independent organisation .

the maya writing system ( often called hieroglyphs from a superficial resemblance to the ancient egyptian writing ) was a combination of phonetic symbols and logograms . it is most often classified as a logographic or ( more properly ) a logosyllabic writing system , in which syllabic signs play a significant role . it is the only pre-columbian writing system known to represent completely the spoken language of its community . in total , the script has more than one thousand different glyphs although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities . at any one time , no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use , some two hundred of which ( including variations ) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation .
genetic studies of mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) of amerindians and some siberian and central asian peoples also revealed that the gene pool of the turkic-speaking peoples of siberia such as altaians , khakas , shors and soyots , living between the altai and lake baikal along the sayan mountains , are genetically closest to amerindians . [ citation needed ] this view is shared by other researchers who argue that " the ancestors of the american indians were the first to separate from the great asian population in the middle paleolithic . 2012 research found evidence for a recent common ancestry between native americans and indigenous altaians based on mitochondrial dna and y-chromosome analysis . the paternal lineages of altaians mostly belong to the subclades of haplogroup p-m45 ( xr1a 38-93 % ; xq1a 4-32 % ) .
funafuti is the largest atoll of the nine low reef islands and atolls that form the tuvalu volcanic island chain . it comprises numerous islets around a central lagoon that is approximately 25.1 kilometres ( 15.6 miles ) ( n–s ) by 18.4 kilometres ( 11.4 miles ) ( w-e ) , centred on 179°7'e and 8°30 's . on the atolls , an annular reef rim surrounds the lagoon with several natural reef channels . surveys were carried out in may 2010 of the reef habitats of nanumea , nukulaelae and funafuti and a total of 317 fish species were recorded during this tuvalu marine life study . the surveys identified 66 species that had not previously been recorded in tuvalu , which brings the total number of identified species to 607 .
the company , which benefited from the imperial patronage , soon expanded its commercial trading operations , eclipsing the portuguese estado da índia , which had established bases in goa , chittagong , and bombay , which portugal later ceded to england as part of the dowry of catherine de braganza . the east india company also launched a joint attack with the dutch united east india company on portuguese and spanish ships off the coast of china , which helped secure their ports in china . the company established trading posts in surat ( 1619 ) , madras ( 1639 ) , bombay ( 1668 ) , and calcutta ( 1690 ) . by 1647 , the company had 23 factories , each under the command of a factor or master merchant and governor if so chosen , and 90 employees in india . the major factories became the walled forts of fort william in bengal , fort st george in madras , and bombay castle .
in process known as the marian reforms , roman consul gaius marius carried out a programme of reform of the roman military . in 107 bc , all citizens , regardless of their wealth or social class , were made eligible for entry into the roman army . this move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries , of removing property requirements for military service . the distinction between the three heavy infantry classes , which had already become blurred , had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry . the heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock , while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry . the army 's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the roman aristocracy .

the foundation of northwestern university is traceable to a meeting on may 31 , 1850 of nine prominent chicago businessmen , methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once been known as the northwest territory . on january 28 , 1851 , the illinois general assembly granted a charter to the trustees of the north-western university , making it the first chartered university in illinois . the school 's nine founders , all of whom were methodists ( three of them ministers ) , knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting . although they affiliated the university with the methodist episcopal church , they were committed to non-sectarian admissions , believing that northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory .
the word " public " implies the highest level of inclusivity – the public sphere by definition should be open to all . however , this sphere was only public to relative degrees . enlightenment thinkers frequently contrasted their conception of the " public " with that of the people : condorcet contrasted " opinion " with populace , marmontel " the opinion of men of letters " with " the opinion of the multitude , " and d'alembert the " truly enlightened public " with " the blind and noisy multitude " . additionally , most institutions of the public sphere excluded both women and the lower classes . cross-class influences occurred through noble and lower class participation in areas such as the coffeehouses and the masonic lodges .
beginning and ending dates are roughly the reverse in the southern hemisphere . for example , mainland chile observed dst from the second saturday in october to the second saturday in march , with transitions at 24:00 local time . the time difference between the united kingdom and mainland chile could therefore be five hours during the northern summer , three hours during the southern summer and four hours a few weeks per year because of mismatch of changing dates .

the times used contributions from significant figures in the fields of politics , science , literature , and the arts to build its reputation . for much of its early life , the profits of the times were very large and the competition minimal , so it could pay far better than its rivals for information or writers . beginning in 1814 , the paper was printed on the new steam-driven cylinder press developed by friedrich koenig . in 1815 , the times had a circulation of 5,000 .
by the start of the 20th century , germany and the united states challenged britain 's economic lead . subsequent military and economic tensions between britain and germany were major causes of the first world war , during which britain relied heavily upon its empire . the conflict placed enormous strain on the military , financial and manpower resources of britain . although the british empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after world war i , britain was no longer the world 's pre-eminent industrial or military power . in the second world war , britain 's colonies in south-east asia were occupied by imperial japan . despite the final victory of britain and its allies , the damage to british prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire . india , britain 's most valuable and populous possession , achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which britain granted independence to most territories of the empire . the transfer of hong kong to china in 1997 marked for many the end of the british empire . fourteen overseas territories remain under british sovereignty . after independence , many former british colonies joined the commonwealth of nations , a free association of independent states . the united kingdom is now one of 16 commonwealth nations , a grouping known informally as the commonwealth realms , that share one monarch—queen elizabeth ii .

in comparison to the principal alternative , the diesel engine , electric railways offer substantially better energy efficiency , lower emissions and lower operating costs . electric locomotives are usually quieter , more powerful , and more responsive and reliable than diesels . they have no local emissions , an important advantage in tunnels and urban areas . some electric traction systems provide regenerative braking that turns the train 's kinetic energy back into electricity and returns it to the supply system to be used by other trains or the general utility grid . while diesel locomotives burn petroleum , electricity is generated from diverse sources including many that do not produce carbon dioxide such as nuclear power and renewable forms including hydroelectric , geothermal , wind and solar .
modern separation techniques such as milling , centrifugation , and pressing have enabled concentration of particular components of food , yielding flour , oils , juices , and so on , and even separate fatty acids , amino acids , vitamins , and minerals . inevitably , such large-scale concentration changes the nutritional content of food , saving certain nutrients while removing others . heating techniques may also reduce food 's content of many heat-labile nutrients such as certain vitamins and phytochemicals , and possibly other yet-to-be-discovered substances . because of reduced nutritional value , processed foods are often 'enriched ' or 'fortified ' with some of the most critical nutrients ( usually certain vitamins ) that were lost during processing . nonetheless , processed foods tend to have an inferior nutritional profile compared to whole , fresh foods , regarding content of both sugar and high gi starches , potassium/sodium , vitamins , fiber , and of intact , unoxidized ( essential ) fatty acids . in addition , processed foods often contain potentially harmful substances such as oxidized fats and trans fatty acids .
on 20 december 2012 , pope benedict xvi , in an audience with the cardinal prefect of the congregation for the causes of saints , declared that the late pontiff had lived a life of heroic virtue , which means that he could be called " venerable " . a miracle attributed to the intercession of paul vi was approved on 9 may 2014 by pope francis . the beatification ceremony for paul vi was held on 19 october 2014 , which means that he can now be called " blessed " . his liturgical feast day is celebrated on the date of his birth , 26 september , rather than the day of his death as is usual .
despite being a persistent critic of some of the government 's policies , the paper supported labour in both subsequent elections the party won . for the 2005 general election , the sun backed blair and labour for a third consecutive election win and vowed to give him " one last chance " to fulfil his promises , despite berating him for several weaknesses including a failure to control immigration . however , it did speak of its hope that the conservatives ( led by michael howard ) would one day be fit for a return to government . this election ( blair had declared it would be his last as prime minister ) resulted in labour 's third successive win but with a much reduced majority .
the development of new technologies has made it dramatically easier and cheaper to do sequencing , and the number of complete genome sequences is growing rapidly . the us national institutes of health maintains one of several comprehensive databases of genomic information . among the thousands of completed genome sequencing projects include those for rice , a mouse , the plant arabidopsis thaliana , the puffer fish , and the bacteria e. coli . in december 2013 , scientists first sequenced the entire genome of a neanderthal , an extinct species of humans . the genome was extracted from the toe bone of a 130,000-year-old neanderthal found in a siberian cave .
several dozen radioisotopes have been characterized . 65zn , which has a half-life of 243.66 days , is the most long-lived radioisotope , followed by 72zn with a half-life of 46.5 hours . zinc has 10 nuclear isomers . 69mzn has the longest half-life , 13.76 h. the superscript m indicates a metastable isotope . the nucleus of a metastable isotope is in an excited state and will return to the ground state by emitting a photon in the form of a gamma ray . 61zn has three excited states and 73zn has two . the isotopes 65zn , 71zn , 77zn and 78zn each have only one excited state .
internal courtyards became more rare , except beside the stables , and the functional parts of the building were placed at the sides , or in separate buildings nearby hidden by trees . the views to and from the front and rear of the main block were concentrated on , with the side approaches usually much less important . the roof was typically invisible from the ground , though domes were sometimes visible in grander buildings . the roofline was generally clear of ornament except for a balustrade or the top of a pediment . columns or pilasters , often topped by a pediment , were popular for ornament inside and out , and other ornament was generally geometrical or plant-based , rather than using the human figure .
enlisted members of the usaf have pay grades from e-1 ( entry level ) to e-9 ( senior enlisted ) . while all usaf military personnel are referred to as airmen , the term also refers to the pay grades of e-1 through e-4 , which are below the level of non-commissioned officers ( ncos ) . above the pay grade of e-4 ( i.e. , pay grades e-5 through e-9 ) all ranks fall into the category of nco and are further subdivided into " ncos " ( pay grades e-5 and e-6 ) and " senior ncos " ( pay grades e-7 through e-9 ) ; the term " junior nco " is sometimes used to refer to staff sergeants and technical sergeants ( pay grades e-5 and e-6 ) .
a year before alfonso iii " the great " of asturias death , three of alfonso 's sons rose in rebellion and forced him to abdicate , partitioning the kingdom among them . the eldest son , garcía , became king of león . the second son , ordoño , reigned in galicia , while the third , fruela , received asturias with oviedo as his capital . alfonso died in zamora , probably in 910 . his former realm would be reunited when first garcía died childless and león passed to ordoño . he in turn died when his children were too young to ascend ; fruela became king of a reunited crown . his death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century . it continued under that name [ clarification needed ] until incorporated into the kingdom of castile in 1230 , after ferdinand iii became joint king of the two kingdoms . this was done to avoid dynastic feuds and to maintain the christian kingdoms strong enough to prevent complete muslim take over of the iberian peninsula and to further the reconquista of iberia by christian armies .
according to the tradition , virgil traveled to greece in about 19 bc to revise the aeneid . after meeting augustus in athens and deciding to return home , virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near megara . after crossing to italy by ship , weakened with disease , virgil died in brundisium harbor on september 21 , 19 bc . augustus ordered virgil 's literary executors , lucius varius rufus and plotius tucca , to disregard virgil 's own wish that the poem be burned , instead ordering it published with as few editorial changes as possible . as a result , the text of the aeneid that exists may contain faults which virgil was planning to correct before publication . however , the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished ( i.e . not a complete line of dactylic hexameter ) . some scholars have argued that virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect . other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate .
under the qing dynasty ( 1644–1911 ) , the nanjing area was known as jiangning ( 江寧 ) and served as the seat of government for the viceroy of liangjiang . it had been visited by the kangxi and qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces . nanjing was invaded by british troops during the close of the first opium war , which was ended by the treaty of nanjing in 1842 . as the capital of the brief-lived rebel taiping heavenly kingdom ( founded by the taiping rebels in the mid-19th century , nanjing was known as tianjing ( 天京 , " heavenly capital " or " capital of heaven " ) .
working with photographer steven klein , madonna completed a 17-minute film called secretprojectrevolution . the bittorrent company was selected by madonna to release the film as part of a madonna bundle . it was released on september 24 , 2013 , and consisted of the 17-minute film , its stills , a vice interview , and a message from madonna . with the film she launched the art for freedom initiative , which helped to promote " art and free speech as a means to address persecution and injustice across the globe " . the website for the project has had over 3,000 art related submissions since its inception , with madonna regularly monitoring and enlisting the help of other artists like david blaine and katy perry as guest curators .
in addition , the paris region is served by a light rail network of nine lines , the tramway : line t1 runs from asnières-gennevilliers to noisy-le-sec , line t2 runs from pont de bezons to porte de versailles , line t3a runs from pont du garigliano to porte de vincennes , line t3b runs from porte de vincennes to porte de la chapelle , line t5 runs from saint-denis to garges-sarcelles , line t6 runs from châtillon to velizy , line t7 runs from villejuif to athis-mons , line t8 runs from saint-denis to épinay-sur-seine and villetaneuse , all of which are operated by the régie autonome des transports parisiens , and line t4 runs from bondy rer to aulnay-sous-bois , which is operated by the state rail carrier sncf . five new light rail lines are currently in various stages of development .
a key aspect of the gates foundation 's u.s. efforts involves an overhaul of the country 's education policies at both the k-12 and college levels , including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to seniority-based layoffs and other aspects of the education system that are typically backed by teachers ' unions . it spent $ 373 million on education in 2009 . it has also donated to the two largest national teachers ' unions . the foundation was the biggest early backer of the common core state standards initiative .
the antebellum age was a period of increasing division in the country based on the growth of slavery in the american south and in the western territories of kansas and nebraska that eventually lead to the civil war in 1861 . the antebellum period is often considered to have begun with the kansas–nebraska act of 1854 , [ citation needed ] although it may have begun as early as 1812 . this period is also significant because it marked the transition of american manufacturing to the industrial revolution .

independence was unilaterally declared on 24 september 1973 . recognition became universal following the 25 april 1974 socialist-inspired military coup in portugal , which overthrew lisbon 's estado novo regime .
in many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans , local communities , and even nations . r. kapuscinski says that europeans who are polite , modest , or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games . the côte d'ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation 's civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of bouaké , an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time . by contrast , football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the football war in june 1969 between el salvador and honduras . the sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the yugoslav wars of the 1990s , when a match between dinamo zagreb and red star belgrade degenerated into rioting in may 1990 .
in the 1990s , dell switched from using primarily atx motherboards and psu to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors . this meant customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts . while motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003 , dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals ( such as mmc readers and power on/off switches and leds ) .
eritrea 's ethnic groups each have their own styles of music and accompanying dances . amongst the tigrinya , the best known traditional musical genre is the guaila . traditional instruments of eritrean folk music include the stringed krar , kebero , begena , masenqo and the wata ( a distant/rudimentary cousin of the violin ) . the most popular eritrean artist is the tigrinya singer helen meles , who is noted for her powerful voice and wide singing range . other prominent local musicians include the kunama singer dehab faytinga , ruth abraha , bereket mengisteab , yemane baria , and the late abraham afewerki .
chocolate is new york city 's leading specialty-food export , with up to us $ 234 million worth of exports each year . entrepreneurs were forming a " chocolate district " in brooklyn as of 2014 , while godiva , one of the world 's largest chocolatiers , continues to be headquartered in manhattan .
many applications of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency , which gives rise to one of silicate glasses ' primary uses as window panes . glass will transmit , reflect and refract light ; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses , prisms , fine glassware , and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light . glass can be colored by adding metallic salts , and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels . these qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular , stained glass windows . although brittle , silicate glass is extremely durable , and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures . because glass can be formed or molded into any shape , and also because it is a sterile product , it has been traditionally used for vessels : bowls , vases , bottles , jars and drinking glasses . in its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights , marbles , and beads . when extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air , it becomes a thermal insulating material , and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic , they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass . some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material , such as drinking glasses and reading glasses .
hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in india with the decline of the mughal empire . after the fall of delhi in 1857 , the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the indian sub continent , under the patronage of the nizam , enriched the cultural milieu . this migration resulted in a mingling of north and south indian languages , cultures and religions , which has since led to a co-existence of hindu and muslim traditions , for which the city has become noted . : viii a further consequence of this north–south mix is that both telugu and urdu are official languages of telangana . the mixing of religions has also resulted in many festivals being celebrated in hyderabad such as ganesh chaturthi , diwali and bonalu of hindu tradition and eid ul-fitr and eid al-adha by muslims .
beyoncé and her mother introduced house of deréon , a contemporary women 's fashion line , in 2005 . the concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family , the name paying tribute to beyoncé 's grandmother , agnèz deréon , a respected seamstress . according to tina , the overall style of the line best reflects her and beyoncé 's taste and style . beyoncé and her mother founded their family 's company beyond productions , which provides the licensing and brand management for house of deréon , and its junior collection , deréon . house of deréon pieces were exhibited in destiny 's child 's shows and tours , during their destiny fulfilled era . the collection features sportswear , denim offerings with fur , outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear , and are available at department and specialty stores across the us and canada .
with crude oil as the country 's primary export , gaddafi sought to improve libya 's oil sector . in october 1969 , he proclaimed the current trade terms unfair , benefiting foreign corporations more than the libyan state , and by threatening to reduce production , in december jalloud successfully increased the price of libyan oil . in 1970 , other opec states followed suit , leading to a global increase in the price of crude oil . the rcc followed with the tripoli agreement , in which they secured income tax , back-payments and better pricing from the oil corporations ; these measures brought libya an estimated $ 1 billion in additional revenues in its first year .
new zealand has a strong hunting culture . the islands making up new zealand originally had no land mammals apart from bats . however , once europeans arrived , game animals were introduced by acclimatisation societies to provide new zealanders with sport and a hunting resource . deer , pigs , goats , rabbits , hare , tahr and chamois all adapted well to the new zealand terrain , and with no natural predators , their population exploded . government agencies view the animals as pests due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production , but hunters view them as a resource .
capacitors , especially ceramic capacitors , and older designs such as paper capacitors , can absorb sound waves resulting in a microphonic effect . vibration moves the plates , causing the capacitance to vary , in turn inducing ac current . some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity . the resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications , potentially causing feedback or unintended recording . in the reverse microphonic effect , the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force , moving them as a speaker . this can generate audible sound , but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte , if any .
fetuvalu offers the cambridge syllabus . motufoua offers the fiji junior certificate ( fjc ) at year 10 , tuvaluan certificate at year 11 and the pacific senior secondary certificate ( pssc ) at year 12 , set by the fiji-based exam board spbea . sixth form students who pass their pssc go on to the augmented foundation programme , funded by the government of tuvalu . this program is required for tertiary education programmes outside of tuvalu and is available at the university of the south pacific ( usp ) extension centre in funafuti .
there are many missionary groups operating in the country , including lutherans , baptists , catholics , grace brethren , and jehovah 's witnesses . while these missionaries are predominantly from the united states , france , italy , and spain , many are also from nigeria , the democratic republic of the congo , and other african countries . large numbers of missionaries left the country when fighting broke out between rebel and government forces in 2002–3 , but many of them have now returned to continue their work .
to aid customers with defective consoles , microsoft extended the xbox 360 's manufacturer 's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a " general hardware failure " error report . a " general hardware failure " is recognized on all models released before the xbox 360 s by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red . this error is often known as the " red ring of death " . in april 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the e74 error code . the warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate these specific error codes .
all the electromagnetic motors , and that includes the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields . for calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap . once these have been established by mathematical analysis using fea or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector . the current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current . this makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed .
street vendors play their trade from stalls in the tianguis as well as at non-officially controlled concentrations around metro stations and hospitals ; at plazas comerciales , where vendors of a certain " theme " ( e.g . stationery ) are housed ; originally these were organized to accommodate vendors formerly selling on the street ; or simply from improvised stalls on a city sidewalk . in addition , food and goods are sold from people walking with baskets , pushing carts , from bicycles or the backs of trucks , or simply from a tarp or cloth laid on the ground .
light is the signal by which plants synchronize their internal clocks to their environment and is sensed by a wide variety of photoreceptors . red and blue light are absorbed through several phytochromes and cryptochromes . one phytochrome , phya , is the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the dark but rapidly degrades in light to produce cry1 . phytochromes b–e are more stable with phyb , the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the light . the cryptochrome ( cry ) gene is also a light-sensitive component of the circadian clock and is thought to be involved both as a photoreceptor and as part of the clock 's endogenous pacemaker mechanism . cryptochromes 1–2 ( involved in blue–uva ) help to maintain the period length in the clock through a whole range of light conditions .
in book 11 of his confessions , st. augustine of hippo ruminates on the nature of time , asking , " what then is time ? if no one asks me , i know : if i wish to explain it to one that asketh , i know not . " he begins to define time by what it is not rather than what it is , an approach similar to that taken in other negative definitions . however , augustine ends up calling time a “ distention ” of the mind ( confessions 11.26 ) by which we simultaneously grasp the past in memory , the present by attention , and the future by expectation .
some countries were not included for various reasons , mainly the unavailability of certain crucial data . the following united nations member states were not included in the 2010 report . cuba lodged a formal protest at its lack of inclusion . the undp explained that cuba had been excluded due to the lack of an " internationally reported figure for cuba ’ s gross national income adjusted for purchasing power parity " . all other indicators for cuba were available , and reported by the undp , but the lack of one indicator meant that no ranking could be attributed to the country . the situation has been addressed and , in later years , cuba has ranked as a high human development country .
a thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives , including psychology , biology , history , sociology , education , and anthropology . within all of these perspectives , adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood , whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles . it is a period of multiple transitions involving education , training , employment and unemployment , as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another .
the republic of liberia , beginning as a settlement of the american colonization society ( acs ) , declared its independence on july 26 , 1847 . the united states did not recognize liberia 's independence until during the american civil war on february 5 , 1862 . between january 7 , 1822 and the american civil war , more than 15,000 freed and free-born black americans from united states and 3,198 afro-caribbeans relocated to the settlement . the black american settlers carried their culture with them to liberia . the liberian constitution and flag were modeled after the united states . in january 3 , 1848 joseph jenkins roberts , a wealthy free-born black american from virginia who settled in liberia , was elected as liberia 's first president after the people proclaimed independence .
in addition to the minimal units that can serve the purpose of differentiating meaning ( the phonemes ) , phonology studies how sounds alternate , i.e . replace one another in different forms of the same morpheme ( allomorphs ) , as well as , for example , syllable structure , stress , feature geometry , accent , and intonation .
in the us , residents in the line of sight of television station broadcast antennas can receive free , over the air programming with a television set with an atsc tuner ( most sets sold since 2009 have this ) . this is achieved with a tv aerial , just as it has been since the 1940s except now the major network signals are broadcast in high definition ( abc , fox , and ion television broadcast at 720p resolution ; cbs , my network tv , nbc , pbs , and the cw at 1080i ) . as their digital signals more efficiently use the broadcast channel , many broadcasters are adding multiple channels to their signals . laws about antennas were updated before the change to digital terrestrial broadcasts . these new laws prohibit home owners ' associations and city government from banning the installation of antennas .
alongside the capital , the most popular tourist destinations are isfahan , mashhad and shiraz . in the early 2000s , the industry faced serious limitations in infrastructure , communications , industry standards and personnel training . the majority of the 300,000 tourist visas granted in 2003 were obtained by asian muslims , who presumably intended to visit important pilgrimage sites in mashhad and qom . several organized tours from germany , france and other european countries come to iran annually to visit archaeological sites and monuments . in 2003 , iran ranked 68th in tourism revenues worldwide . according to unesco and the deputy head of research for iran travel and tourism organization ( itto ) , iran is rated 4th among the top 10 destinations in the middle east . domestic tourism in iran is one of the largest in the world . weak advertising , unstable regional conditions , a poor public image in some parts of the world , and absence of efficient planning schemes in the tourism sector have all hindered the growth of tourism .
the yale report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the latin and greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages , mathematics , and science . unlike higher education in europe , there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the united states . in the competition for students and financial support , college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation . at the same time , they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background . the yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned . all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum , often resulting in a dual track . in the decentralized environment of higher education in the united states , balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical . a group of professors at yale and new haven congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the victorian culture . they concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within , yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms ' ( professionalism , materialism , individualism , and consumerism ) tempting him from without . william graham sumner , professor from 1872 to 1909 , taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms . he bested president noah porter , who disliked social science and wanted yale to lock into its traditions of classical education . porter objected to sumner 's use of a textbook by herbert spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students .
the european colonization of the americas forever changed the lives and cultures of the peoples of the continents . although the exact pre-contact population of the americas is unknown , scholars estimate that native american populations diminished by between 80 and 90 % within the first centuries of contact with europeans . the leading cause was disease . the continent was ravaged by epidemics of diseases such as smallpox , measles , and cholera , which were brought from europe by the early explorers and spread quickly into new areas even before later explorers and colonists reached them . native americans suffered high mortality rates due to their lack of prior exposure to these diseases . the loss of lives was exacerbated by conflict between colonists and indigenous people . colonists also frequently perpetrated massacres on the indigenous groups and enslaved them . according to the u.s. bureau of the census ( 1894 ) , the north american indian wars of the 19th century cost the lives of about 19,000 whites and 30,000 native americans .
the governments of australia and new zealand responded to the 2011 fresh-water crisis by supplying temporary desalination plants , and assisted in the repair of the existing desalination unit that was donated by japan in 2006 . in response to the 2011 drought , japan funded the purchase of a 100 m3/d desalination plant and two portable 10 m3/d plants as part of its pacific environment community ( pec ) program . aid programs from the european union and australia also provided water tanks as part of the longer term solution for the storage of available fresh water .
with the financial expansion , trading rights became more jealously guarded by the commercial elite . towns saw the growing power of guilds , while on a national level special companies would be granted monopolies on particular trades , like the english wool staple . the beneficiaries of these developments would accumulate immense wealth . families like the fuggers in germany , the medicis in italy , the de la poles in england , and individuals like jacques coeur in france would help finance the wars of kings , and achieve great political influence in the process .
for at least a century before the establishment of the augustan principate , jews and judaism were tolerated in rome by diplomatic treaty with judaea 's hellenised elite . diaspora jews had much in common with the overwhelmingly hellenic or hellenised communities that surrounded them . early italian synagogues have left few traces ; but one was dedicated in ostia around the mid-1st century bc and several more are attested during the imperial period . judaea 's enrollment as a client kingdom in 63 bc increased the jewish diaspora ; in rome , this led to closer official scrutiny of their religion . their synagogues were recognised as legitimate collegia by julius caesar . by the augustan era , the city of rome was home to several thousand jews . in some periods under roman rule , jews were legally exempt from official sacrifice , under certain conditions . judaism was a superstitio to cicero , but the church father tertullian described it as religio licita ( an officially permitted religion ) in contrast to christianity .
this boom was reflected in the growth of artistic and cultural pursuits . some of the most emblematic buildings of the city were built during this period , including the serranos towers ( 1392 ) , the lonja ( 1482 ) , the miguelete and the chapel of the kings of the convent of santo domingo . in painting and sculpture , flemish and italian trends had an influence on artists such as lluís dalmau , peris gonçal and damià forment . literature flourished with the patronage of the court of alfonso the magnanimous , supporting authors like ausiàs march , roiç de corella , and isabel de villena . by 1460 joanot martorell wrote tirant lo blanch , an innovative novel of chivalry that influenced many later writers , from cervantes to shakespeare . ausiàs march was one of the first poets to use the everyday language valencian , instead of the troubadour language , occitan . also around this time , between 1499 and 1502 , the university of valencia was founded under the parsimonious name of estudio general ( " studium generale " , place of general studies ) .
in november 1795 , there was a debate in parliament on the high price of corn and burke wrote a memorandum to pitt on the subject . in december samuel whitbread mp introduced a bill giving magistrates the power to fix minimum wages and fox said he would vote for it . this debate probably led burke to editing his memorandum , as there appeared a notice that burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the secretary of the board of agriculture , arthur young ; but he failed to complete it . these fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as , thoughts and details on scarcity . in it , burke expounded " some of the doctrines of political economists bearing upon agriculture as a trade " . burke criticised policies such as maximum prices and state regulation of wages , and set out what the limits of government should be :
around 1890 , a political movement developed in the united states to mandate private executions . several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a " wall " or " enclosure " to " exclude public view . " for example , in 1919 , the missouri legislature adopted a statute ( l.1919 , p. 781 ) which required , " the sentence of death should be executed within the county jail , if convenient , and otherwise within an enclosure near the jail . " the missouri law permitted the local sheriff to distribute passes to individuals ( usually local citizens ) whom he believed should witness the hanging , but the sheriffs – for various reasons – sometimes denied passes to individuals who wanted to watch . missouri executions conducted after 1919 were not " public " because they were conducted behind closed walls , and the general public was not permitted to attend .
regardless of the ability of the luftwaffe to win air superiority , adolf hitler was frustrated that it was not happening quickly enough . with no sign of the raf weakening , and luftwaffe air fleets ( luftflotten ) taking punishing losses , the okl was keen for a change in strategy . to reduce losses further , a change in strategy was also favoured to take place at night , to give the bombers greater protection under cover of darkness . [ b ] on 4 september 1940 , in a long address at the sportspalast , hitler declared : " and should the royal air force drop two thousand , or three thousand [ kilograms ... ] then we will now drop [ ... ] 300,000 , 400,000 , yes one million kilograms in a single night . and should they declare they will greatly increase their attacks on our cities , then we will erase their cities . "
a decade into co-education , rampant student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit alexander v. yale . while unsuccessful in the courts , the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of yale 's grievance board and the yale women 's center . in march 2011 a title ix complaint was filed against yale by students and recent graduates , including editors of yale 's feminist magazine broad recognition , alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate . in response , the university formed a title ix steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct .
balansiyya had a rebirth of sorts with the beginning of the taifa of valencia kingdom in the 11th century . the town grew , and during the reign of abd al-aziz a new city wall was built , remains of which are preserved throughout the old city ( ciutat vella ) today . the castilian nobleman rodrigo diaz de vivar , known as el cid , who was intent on possessing his own principality on the mediterranean , entered the province in command of a combined christian and moorish army and besieged the city beginning in 1092 . by the time the siege ended in may 1094 , he had carved out his own fiefdom—which he ruled from 15 june 1094 to july 1099 . this victory was immortalised in the lay of the cid . during his rule , he converted nine mosques into churches and installed the french monk jérôme as bishop of the see of valencia . el cid was killed in july 1099 while defending the city from an almoravid siege , whereupon his wife ximena díaz ruled in his place for two years .
thus , buckingham palace is a symbol and home of the british monarchy , an art gallery and a tourist attraction . behind the gilded railings and gates which were completed by the bromsgrove guild in 1911 and webb 's famous façade , which has been described in a book published by the royal collection as looking " like everybody 's idea of a palace " , is not only a weekday home of the queen and prince philip but also the london residence of the duke of york and the earl and countess of wessex . the palace also houses the offices of the queen , prince philip , duke of york , earl and countess of wessex , princess royal , and princess alexandra , and is the workplace of more than 800 people .
in mid-1969 , idris travelled abroad to spend the summer in turkey and greece . gaddafi 's free officers recognized this as their chance to overthrow the monarchy , initiating " operation jerusalem " . on 1 september , they occupied airports , police depots , radio stations and government offices in tripoli and benghazi . gaddafi took control of the berka barracks in benghazi , while omar meheisha occupied tripoli barracks and jalloud seized the city 's anti-aircraft batteries . khweldi hameidi was sent to arrest crown prince sayyid hasan ar-rida al-mahdi as-sanussi , and force him to relinquish his claim to the throne . they met no serious resistance , and wielded little violence against the monarchists .
ram can be read and written to anytime the cpu commands it , but rom is preloaded with data and software that never changes , therefore the cpu can only read from it . rom is typically used to store the computer 's initial start-up instructions . in general , the contents of ram are erased when the power to the computer is turned off , but rom retains its data indefinitely . in a pc , the rom contains a specialized program called the bios that orchestrates loading the computer 's operating system from the hard disk drive into ram whenever the computer is turned on or reset . in embedded computers , which frequently do not have disk drives , all of the required software may be stored in rom . software stored in rom is often called firmware , because it is notionally more like hardware than software . flash memory blurs the distinction between rom and ram , as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable . it is typically much slower than conventional rom and ram however , so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary .
worldwide , more chickens are kept than any other type of poultry , with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs . traditionally , such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks , foraging during the day and housed at night . this is still the case in developing countries , where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry . however , rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger , more intensive specialist units . these are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed , and result in cheap , safe food being made available for urban communities . profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed , which has been rising . high feed costs could limit further development of poultry production .
armenians enjoy many different native and foreign foods . arguably the favorite food is khorovats an armenian-styled barbecue . lavash is a very popular armenian flat bread , and armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough . other famous armenian foods include the kabob ( a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables ) , various dolmas ( minced lamb , or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves , cabbage leaves , or stuffed into hollowed vegetables ) , and pilaf , a rice dish . also , ghapama , a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish , and many different salads are popular in armenian culture . fruits play a large part in the armenian diet . apricots ( prunus armeniaca , also known as armenian plum ) have been grown in armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor . peaches are popular as well , as are grapes , figs , pomegranates , and melons . preserves are made from many fruits , including cornelian cherries , young walnuts , sea buckthorn , mulberries , sour cherries , and many others .
on 21 december 2011 the bank instituted a programme of making low-interest loans with a term of three years ( 36 months ) and 1 % interest to european banks accepting loans from the portfolio of the banks as collateral . loans totalling €489.2 bn ( us $ 640 bn ) were announced . the loans were not offered to european states , but government securities issued by european states would be acceptable collateral as would mortgage-backed securities and other commercial paper that can be demonstrated to be secure . the programme was announced on 8 december 2011 but observers were surprised by the volume of the loans made when it was implemented . under its ltro it loaned €489bn to 523 banks for an exceptionally long period of three years at a rate of just one percent . the by far biggest amount of €325bn was tapped by banks in greece , ireland , italy and spain . this way the ecb tried to make sure that banks have enough cash to pay off €200bn of their own maturing debts in the first three months of 2012 , and at the same time keep operating and loaning to businesses so that a credit crunch does not choke off economic growth . it also hoped that banks would use some of the money to buy government bonds , effectively easing the debt crisis .
in 1978 aboriginal writer kevin gilbert received the national book council award for his book living black : blacks talk to kevin gilbert , a collection of aboriginal people 's stories , and in 1998 was awarded ( but refused to accept ) the human rights award for literature for inside black australia , a poetry anthology and exhibition of aboriginal photography . in contrast to previous definitions based solely on the degree of aboriginal ancestry , in 1990 the government changed the legal definition of aboriginal to include any :
the end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors , including the weakening power of the catholic church , the protestant reformation and the banning of religious plays in many countries . elizabeth i forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s . similarly , religious plays were banned in the netherlands in 1539 , the papal states in 1547 and in paris in 1548 . the abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama . it also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in greek and roman theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity .
the music of the indigenous peoples of central mexico and central america was often pentatonic . before the arrival of the spaniards and other europeans , music was inseparable from religious festivities and included a large variety of percussion and wind instruments such as drums , flutes , sea snail shells ( used as a trumpet ) and " rain " tubes . no remnants of pre-columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in guatemala , attributed to the maya of the late classic era ( 600–900 ce ) , which depicts a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced . this instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the americas prior to the introduction of european musical instruments ; when played it produces a sound virtually identical to a jaguar 's growl .
expansion caused controversy about yale 's new roles . noah porter , moral philosopher , was president from 1871 to 1886 . during an age of tremendous expansion in higher education , porter resisted the rise of the new research university , claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education . many of porter 's contemporaries criticized his administration , and historians since have disparaged his leadership . levesque argues porter was not a simple-minded reactionary , uncritically committed to tradition , but a principled and selective conservative . he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new ; rather , he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture . he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time , but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university .
it was rumored that schwarzenegger might run for the united states senate in 2010 , as his governorship would be term-limited by that time . this turned out to be false .
in november 2008 , economist dean baker observed : " there is a really good reason for tighter credit . tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today . businesses are facing the worst downturn since the great depression . this matters for credit decisions . a homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt . they will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and/or have a default placed on their credit record . on the other hand , a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk . in the case of businesses , their creditworthiness depends on their future profits . profit prospects look much worse in november 2008 than they did in november 2007 ... while many banks are obviously at the brink , consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid . the problem with the economy is the loss of close to $ 6 trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth .
in theism , god is the creator and sustainer of the universe , while in deism , god is the creator , but not the sustainer , of the universe . monotheism is the belief in the existence of one god or in the oneness of god . in pantheism , god is the universe itself . in atheism , god is not believed to exist , while god is deemed unknown or unknowable within the context of agnosticism . god has also been conceived as being incorporeal ( immaterial ) , a personal being , the source of all moral obligation , and the " greatest conceivable existent " . many notable philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of god .
many of boston 's medical facilities are associated with universities . the facilities in the longwood medical and academic area and in massachusetts general hospital are affiliated with harvard medical school . tufts medical center ( formerly tufts-new england medical center ) , located in the southern portion of the chinatown neighborhood , is affiliated with tufts university school of medicine . boston medical center , located in the south end neighborhood , is the primary teaching facility for the boston university school of medicine as well as the largest trauma center in the boston area ; it was formed by the merger of boston university hospital and boston city hospital , which was the first municipal hospital in the united states .
cultural depictions of dogs in art extend back thousands of years to when dogs were portrayed on the walls of caves . representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed . hunting scenes were popular in the middle ages and the renaissance . dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance , protection , loyalty , fidelity , faithfulness , watchfulness , and love .
some skyscraper buildings and other types of installation feature a destination operating panel where a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car . the system lets them know which car to wait for , instead of everyone boarding the next car . in this way , travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers , and the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank . although travel time is reduced , passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart . during the down peak period the benefit of destination control will be limited as passengers have a common destination .
many traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times , which included climbing the city wall on january 16 , bathing in qing xi on march 3 , hill hiking on september 9 and others ( the dates are in chinese lunar calendar ) . almost none of them , however , are still celebrated by modern nanjingese .
mary resided in " her own house " [ lk.1:56 ] in nazareth in galilee , possibly with her parents , and during her betrothal — the first stage of a jewish marriage — the angel gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised messiah by conceiving him through the holy spirit , and she responded , " i am the handmaid of the lord . let it be done unto me according to your word . " after a number of months , when joseph was told of her conception in a dream by " an angel of the lord " , he planned to divorce her ; but the angel told him to not hesitate to take her as his wife , which joseph did , thereby formally completing the wedding rites . [ mt 1:18-25 ]

the russian army withdrew and retreated past moscow . napoleon entered the city , assuming its fall would end the war and alexander would negotiate peace . however , on orders of the city 's governor feodor rostopchin , rather than capitulation , moscow was burned . after five weeks , napoleon and his army left . in early november napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in france after the malet coup of 1812 . his army walked through snow up to their knees and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 november alone . after battle of berezina napoleon succeeded to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train . on 5 december , shortly before arriving in vilnius , napoleon left the army in a sledge .
despite their descent from wolves and classification as carnivora , dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as carnivores or omnivores . unlike obligate carnivores , such as the cat family with its shorter small intestine , dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet , and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements . dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods , including vegetables and grains , and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet . comparing dogs and wolves , dogs have adaptations in genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet .
in 1992 , an alabama editorial called for the death of atticus , saying that as liberal as atticus was , he still worked within a system of institutionalized racism and sexism and should not be revered . the editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero . critics of atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in maycomb . however , in 1997 , the alabama state bar erected a monument to atticus in monroeville , marking his existence as the " first commemorative milestone in the state 's judicial history " . in 2008 , lee herself received an honorary special membership to the alabama state bar for creating atticus who " has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor " .
the mosaics of st. peter 's often show lively baroque compositions based on designs or canvases from like ciro ferri , guido reni , domenichino , carlo maratta , and many others . raphael is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting , the transfiguration . many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in st. peter 's , including giovanni battista calandra , fabio cristofari ( died 1689 ) , and pietro paolo cristofari ( died 1743 ) . works of the fabbrica were often used as papal gifts .
the vedic period is named after the indo-aryan culture of north-west india , although other parts of india had a distinct cultural identity during this period . the vedic culture is described in the texts of vedas , still sacred to hindus , which were orally composed in vedic sanskrit . the vedas are some of the oldest extant texts in india . the vedic period , lasting from about 1750 to 500 bce , and contributed the foundations of several cultural aspects of indian subcontinent . in terms of culture , many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the chalcolithic to the iron age in this period .
turkish authorities deny the genocide took place to this day . the armenian genocide is acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides . according to the research conducted by arnold j. toynbee , an estimated 600,000 armenians died during deportation from 1915–16 ) . this figure , however , accounts for solely the first year of the genocide and does not take into account those who died or were killed after the report was compiled on the 24th may 1916 . the international association of genocide scholars places the death toll at " more than a million " . the total number of people killed has been most widely estimated at between 1 and 1.5 million .
before europeans arrived , the philadelphia area was home to the lenape ( delaware ) indians in the village of shackamaxon . the lenape are a native american tribe and first nations band government . they are also called delaware indians and their historical territory was along the delaware river watershed , western long island and the lower hudson valley . [ a ] most lenape were pushed out of their delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding european colonies , exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts . lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases , mainly smallpox , and violent conflict with europeans . iroquois people occasionally fought the lenape . surviving lenape moved west into the upper ohio river basin . the american revolutionary war and united states ' independence pushed them further west . in the 1860s , the united states government sent most lenape remaining in the eastern united states to the indian territory ( present-day oklahoma and surrounding territory ) under the indian removal policy . in the 21st century , most lenape now reside in the us state of oklahoma , with some communities living also in wisconsin , ontario ( canada ) and in their traditional homelands .
the capital of danish estonia ( danish : hertugdømmet estland ) was reval ( tallinn ) , founded at the place of lyndanisse after the invasion of 1219 . the danes built the fortress of castrum danorum at toompea hill . estonians still call their capital " tallinn " , which according to legend derives from taani linna ( meaning danish town or castle ) . reval was granted lübeck city rights ( 1248 ) and joined the hanseatic league . even today , danish influence can be seen in heraldic symbols . the danish cross is on the city of tallinn 's coat of arms , and estonia 's coat of arms displays three lions similar to those found on the danish coat of arms .
in 2008 , india suspended military aid to myanmar over the issue of human rights abuses by the ruling junta , although it has preserved extensive commercial ties , which provide the regime with much-needed revenue . the thaw in relations began on 28 november 2011 , when belarusian prime minister mikhail myasnikovich and his wife ludmila arrived in the capital , naypyidaw , the same day as the country received a visit by us secretary of state hillary rodham clinton , who also met with pro-democracy opposition leader aung san suu kyi . international relations progress indicators continued in september 2012 when aung san suu kyi visited to the us followed by myanmar 's reformist president visit to the united nations .
the office of the federal register publishes the federal register , code of federal regulations , and united states statutes at large , among others . it also administers the electoral college .
dietary minerals are inorganic chemical elements required by living organisms , other than the four elements carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules . the term " mineral " is archaic , since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet . some are heavier than the four just mentioned , including several metals , which often occur as ions in the body . some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally , or at least as complex compounds , or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources ( such as calcium carbonate from ground oyster shells ) . some minerals are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources . on the other hand , minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements ; the most famous is likely iodine in iodized salt which prevents goiter .
the fairs held at the shrines of sufi saints are called urs . they generally mark the death anniversary of the saint . on these occasions devotees assemble in large numbers and pay homage to the memory of the saint . soul inspiring music is played and devotees dance in ecstasy . the music on these occasions is essentially folk and appealing . it forms a part of the folk music through mystic messages . the most important urs are : urs of data ganj buksh at lahore , urs of hazrat sultan bahu at jhang , urs of hazrat shah jewna at jhang , urs of hazrat mian mir at lahore , urs of baba farid ganj shakar at pakpattan , urs of hazrat bahaudin zakria at multan , urs of sakhi sarwar sultan at dera ghazi khan , urs of shah hussain at lahore , urs of hazrat bulleh shah at kasur , urs of hazrat imam bari ( bari shah latif ) at rawalpindi-islamabad and urs of shah inayar qadri ( the murrshad of bulleh shah ) in lahore .
the ministry of defence is one of the united kingdom 's largest landowners , owning 227,300 hectares of land and foreshore ( either freehold or leasehold ) at april 2014 , which was valued at " about £20 billion " . the mod also has " rights of access " to a further 222,000 hectares . in total , this is about 1.8 % of the uk land mass . the total annual cost to support the defence estate is " in excess of £3.3 billion " .
the fifty american states are separate sovereigns , with their own state constitutions , state governments , and state courts . all states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes , an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization , and a judicial branch that applies , interprets , and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations , as well as local ordinances . they retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal constitution , federal statutes , or international treaties ratified by the federal senate . normally , state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law , unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue , in which case a decision may be appealed to the u.s. supreme court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari . state laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence , to the extent that the united states can not be regarded as one legal system as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control , but must be regarded as 50 separate systems of tort law , family law , property law , contract law , criminal law , and so on .
in 2002 , a three judge panel on the ninth circuit court of appeals held that classroom recitation of the pledge of allegiance in a california public school was unconstitutional , even when students were not compelled to recite it , due to the inclusion of the phrase " under god . " in reaction to the case , elk grove unified school district v. newdow , both houses of congress passed measures reaffirming their support for the pledge , and condemning the panel 's ruling . the case was appealed to the supreme court , where the case was ultimately overturned in june 2004 , solely on procedural grounds not related to the substantive constitutional issue . rather , a five-justice majority held that newdow , a non-custodial parent suing on behalf of his daughter , lacked standing to sue .
in 2000 , the five most common self-reported ethnic groups in the state were : american ( 17.3 % ) , african american ( 13.0 % ) , irish ( 9.3 % ) , english ( 9.1 % ) , and german ( 8.3 % ) . most tennesseans who self-identify as having american ancestry are of english and scotch-irish ancestry . an estimated 21–24 % of tennesseans are of predominantly english ancestry . in the 1980 census 1,435,147 tennesseans claimed " english " or " mostly english " ancestry out of a state population of 3,221,354 making them 45 % of the state at the time .
avicenna 's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being ; namely impossibility , contingency , and necessity . avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which can not exist , while the contingent in itself ( mumkin bi-dhatihi ) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction . when actualized , the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself ' ( wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi ) . thus , contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself . the metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different . necessary being due to itself ( wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi ) is true in itself , while the contingent being is 'false in itself ' and 'true due to something else other than itself ' . the necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence . it is what always exists .
the strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the 20th century . vetter 33 , a 10.5 % abv ( 33 degrees plato , hence vetter " 33 " ) doppelbock , was listed in the 1994 guinness book of world records as the strongest beer at that time , though samichlaus , by the swiss brewer hürlimann , had also been listed by the guinness book of world records as the strongest at 14 % abv . since then , some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers . samuel adams reached 20 % abv with millennium , and then surpassed that amount to 25.6 % abv with utopias . the strongest beer brewed in britain was baz 's super brew by parish brewery , a 23 % abv beer . in september 2011 , the scottish brewery brewdog produced ghost deer , which , at 28 % , they claim to be the world 's strongest beer produced by fermentation alone .
in 2007 , the country with the highest estimated incidence rate of tb was swaziland , with 1,200 cases per 100,000 people . india had the largest total incidence , with an estimated 2.0 million new cases . in developed countries , tuberculosis is less common and is found mainly in urban areas . rates per 100,000 people in different areas of the world were : globally 178 , africa 332 , the americas 36 , eastern mediterranean 173 , europe 63 , southeast asia 278 , and western pacific 139 in 2010 . in canada and australia , tuberculosis is many times more common among the aboriginal peoples , especially in remote areas . in the united states native americans have a fivefold greater mortality from tb , and racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 84 % of all reported tb cases .
public religion took place within a sacred precinct that had been marked out ritually by an augur . the original meaning of the latin word templum was this sacred space , and only later referred to a building . rome itself was an intrinsically sacred space ; its ancient boundary ( pomerium ) had been marked by romulus himself with oxen and plough ; what lay within was the earthly home and protectorate of the gods of the state . in rome , the central references for the establishment of an augural templum appear to have been the via sacra ( sacred way ) and the pomerium . magistrates sought divine opinion of proposed official acts through an augur , who read the divine will through observations made within the templum before , during and after an act of sacrifice . divine disapproval could arise through unfit sacrifice , errant rites ( vitium ) or an unacceptable plan of action . if an unfavourable sign was given , the magistrate could repeat the sacrifice until favourable signs were seen , consult with his augural colleagues , or abandon the project . magistrates could use their right of augury ( ius augurum ) to adjourn and overturn the process of law , but were obliged to base their decision on the augur 's observations and advice . for cicero , himself an augur , this made the augur the most powerful authority in the late republic . by his time ( mid 1st century bc ) augury was supervised by the college of pontifices , whose powers were increasingly woven into the magistracies of the cursus honorum .
game players were not the only ones to notice the violence in this game ; us senators herb kohl and joe lieberman convened a congressional hearing on december 9 , 1993 to investigate the marketing of violent video games to children . [ e ] while nintendo took the high ground with moderate success , the hearings led to the creation of the interactive digital software association and the entertainment software rating board , and the inclusion of ratings on all video games . with these ratings in place , nintendo decided its censorship policies were no longer needed .
the northern ireland peace process has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the republic of ireland , northern ireland and the united kingdom . for example , citizens of northern ireland are entitled to the choice of irish or british citizenship or both and the governments of ireland and the united kingdom consult on matters not devolved to the northern ireland executive . the northern ireland executive and the government of ireland also meet as the north/south ministerial council to develop policies common across the island of ireland . these arrangements were made following the 1998 good friday agreement .
diaz 's plans called for the entire city to eventually be modernized or rebuilt in the porfirian/french style of the colonia roma ; but the mexican revolution began soon afterward and the plans never came to fruition , with many projects being left half-completed . one of the best examples of this is the monument to the mexican revolution . originally the monument was to be the main dome of diaz 's new senate hall , but when the revolution erupted only the dome of the senate hall and its supporting pillars were completed , this was subsequently seen as a symbol by many mexicans that the porfirian era was over once and for all and as such , it was turned into a monument to victory over diaz .
the effective military and bureaucratic structures of the previous century came under strain during a protracted period of misrule by weak sultans . the ottomans gradually fell behind the europeans in military technology as the innovation that fed the empire 's forceful expansion became stifled by growing religious and intellectual conservatism . but in spite of these difficulties , the empire remained a major expansionist power until the battle of vienna in 1683 , which marked the end of ottoman expansion into europe .
following the events in olympia , there were reports that china requested permission to deploy people 's liberation army personnel along the relay route to protect the flame in canberra . australian authorities stated that such a request , if it were to be made , would be refused . chinese officials labeled it a rumor . australian police have been given powers to search relay spectators , following a call by the chinese students and scholars association for chinese australian students to " go defend our sacred torch " against " ethnic degenerate scum and anti-china separatists " . tony goh , chairman of the australian council of chinese organisations , has said the acco would be taking " thousands " of pro-beijing demonstrators to canberra by bus , to support the torch relay . zhang rongan , a chinese australian student organising pro-beijing demonstrations , told the press that chinese diplomats were assisting with the organization of buses , meals and accommodation for pro-beijing demonstrators , and helping them organise a " peaceful show of strength " . foreign minister stephen smith said chinese officials were urging supporters to " turn up and put a point of view " , but that he had no objection to it as long as they remained peaceful .
in 2000 , the fbi began the trilogy project to upgrade its outdated information technology ( it ) infrastructure . this project , originally scheduled to take three years and cost around $ 380 million , ended up going far over budget and behind schedule . efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful , but attempts to develop new investigation software , outsourced to science applications international corporation ( saic ) , were not . virtual case file , or vcf , as the software was known , was plagued by poorly defined goals , and repeated changes in management . in january 2005 , more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion , the fbi officially abandoned the project . at least $ 100 million ( and much more by some estimates ) was spent on the project , which never became operational . the fbi has been forced to continue using its decade-old automated case support system , which it experts consider woefully inadequate . in march 2005 , the fbi announced it was beginning a new , more ambitious software project , code-named sentinel , which they expected to complete by 2009 .
in the late 19th century , three european-american middle-class female teachers married indigenous american men they had met at hampton institute during the years when it ran its indian program . in the late nineteenth century , charles eastman , a physician of european and sioux ancestry who trained at boston university , married elaine goodale , a european-american woman from new england . they met and worked together in dakota territory when she was superintendent of indian education and he was a doctor for the reservations . his maternal grandfather was seth eastman , an artist and army officer from new england , who had married a sioux woman and had a daughter with her while stationed at fort snelling in minnesota .
older operating systems such as tops-10 , along with cp/m , tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control-z ( sub ) to mark the end of the actual text in the file . for this reason , eof , or end-of-file , was used colloquially and conventionally as a three-letter acronym for control-z instead of substitute . the end-of-text code ( etx ) , also known as control-c , was inappropriate for a variety of reasons , while using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid . a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream , usually from a keyboard .
the standard specifies how speed ratings should be reported by the camera . if the noise-based speed ( 40:1 ) is higher than the saturation-based speed , the noise-based speed should be reported , rounded downwards to a standard value ( e.g . 200 , 250 , 320 , or 400 ) . the rationale is that exposure according to the lower saturation-based speed would not result in a visibly better image . in addition , an exposure latitude can be specified , ranging from the saturation-based speed to the 10:1 noise-based speed . if the noise-based speed ( 40:1 ) is lower than the saturation-based speed , or undefined because of high noise , the saturation-based speed is specified , rounded upwards to a standard value , because using the noise-based speed would lead to overexposed images . the camera may also report the sos-based speed ( explicitly as being an sos speed ) , rounded to the nearest standard speed rating .
most cotton in the united states , europe and australia is harvested mechanically , either by a cotton picker , a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant , or by a cotton stripper , which strips the entire boll off the plant . cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton , and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze . cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics , and without defoliation or freezing , the plant will continue to grow .
new zealand has an annual quota of 75 tuvaluans granted work permits under the pacific access category , as announced in 2001 . the applicants register for the pacific access category ( pac ) ballots ; the primary criteria is that the principal applicant must have a job offer from a new zealand employer . tuvaluans also have access to seasonal employment in the horticulture and viticulture industries in new zealand under the recognised seasonal employer ( rse ) work policy introduced in 2007 allowing for employment of up to 5,000 workers from tuvalu and other pacific islands . tuvaluans can participate in the australian pacific seasonal worker program , which allows pacific islanders to obtain seasonal employment in the australian agriculture industry , in particular cotton and cane operations ; fishing industry , in particular aquaculture ; and with accommodation providers in the tourism industry .
new york city 's public bus fleet is the largest in north america , and the port authority bus terminal , the main intercity bus terminal of the city , serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily , making it the busiest bus station in the world .
the sangoma is a traditional diviner chosen by the ancestors of that particular family . the training of the sangoma is called " kwetfwasa " . at the end of the training , a graduation ceremony takes place where all the local sangoma come together for feasting and dancing . the diviner is consulted for various reasons , such the cause of sickness or even death . his diagnosis is based on " kubhula " , a process of communication , through trance , with the natural superpowers . the inyanga ( a medical and pharmaceutical specialist in western terms ) possesses the bone throwing skill ( " kushaya ematsambo " ) used to determine the cause of the sickness .
the german higher education system comprises two forms of academic institutions : universities and polytechnics ( fachhochschule ) . the university of jena is the biggest amongst thuringia 's four universities and offers nearly every discipline . it was founded in 1558 , and today has 21,000 students . the second-largest is the technische universität ilmenau with 7,000 students , founded in 1894 , which offers many technical disciplines such as engineering and mathematics . the university of erfurt , founded in 1392 , has 5,000 students today and an emphasis on humanities and teacher training . the bauhaus university weimar with 4,000 students is thuringia 's smallest university , specialising in creative subjects such as architecture and arts . it was founded in 1860 and came to prominence as germany 's leading art school during the inter-war period , the bauhaus .
in 1902 , the siemens company developed a tantalum lamp filament . these lamps were more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments and could operate at higher temperatures . since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon , the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports . the metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use ; the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use . this made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile . metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding , though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament . general electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the us until 1913 .
after the dambusters raid in 1943 an entirely new system was developed that was required to knock down any low-flying aircraft with a single hit . the first attempt to produce such a system used a 50 mm gun , but this proved inaccurate and a new 55 mm gun replaced it . the system used a centralised control system including both search and targeting radar , which calculated the aim point for the guns after considering windage and ballistics , and then sent electrical commands to the guns , which used hydraulics to point themselves at high speeds . operators simply fed the guns and selected the targets . this system , modern even by today 's standards , was in late development when the war ended .
with an estimated population of 1,381,069 as of july 1 , 2014 , san diego is the eighth-largest city in the united states and second-largest in california . it is part of the san diego–tijuana conurbation , the second-largest transborder agglomeration between the us and a bordering country after detroit–windsor , with a population of 4,922,723 people . san diego is the birthplace of california and is known for its mild year-round climate , natural deep-water harbor , extensive beaches , long association with the united states navy and recent emergence as a healthcare and biotechnology development center .
it was believed that when people died , they would be confined to a gloomy world of ereshkigal , whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving . the dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse , along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food . those who could afford it sought burial at dilmun . human sacrifice was found in the death pits at the ur royal cemetery where queen puabi was accompanied in death by her servants . it is also said that the sumerians invented the first oboe-like instrument , and used them at royal funerals .
provide campaign assistance . minority leaders are typically energetic and aggressive campaigners for partisan incumbents and challengers . there is hardly any major aspect of campaigning that does not engage their attention . for example , they assist in recruiting qualified candidates ; they establish " leadership pacs " to raise and distribute funds to house candidates of their party ; they try to persuade partisan colleagues not to retire or run for other offices so as to hold down the number of open seats the party would need to defend ; they coordinate their campaign activities with congressional and national party campaign committees ; they encourage outside groups to back their candidates ; they travel around the country to speak on behalf of party candidates ; and they encourage incumbent colleagues to make significant financial contributions to the party 's campaign committee . " the amount of time that [ minority leader ] gephardt is putting in to help the dccc [ democratic congressional campaign committee ] is unheard of , " noted a democratic lobbyist . " no dccc chairman has ever had that kind of support . "
north carolina made the smallest per-capita contribution to the war of any state , as only 7,800 men joined the continental army under general george washington ; an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as general nathanael greene . there was some military action , especially in 1780–81 . many carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains , into the washington district ( later known as tennessee ) , but in 1789 , following the revolution , the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands . it ceded them to the national government so that the northwest territory could be organized and managed nationally .

bell is also credited with developing one of the early versions of a metal detector in 1881 . the device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of u.s. president james garfield . according to some accounts , the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin 's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the president was lying disturbed the instrument , resulting in static . the president 's surgeons , who were skeptical of the device , ignored bell 's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs . alternatively , although bell had detected a slight sound on his first test , the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus .
the american professor robert h. goddard had worked on developing solid-fuel rockets since 1914 , and demonstrated a light battlefield rocket to the us army signal corps only five days before the signing of the armistice that ended world war i . he also started developing liquid-fueled rockets in 1921 ; yet he had not been taken seriously by the public , and was not sponsored by the government as part of the post-ww ii rocket development effort . von braun , himself inspired by goddard 's work , was bemused by this when debriefed by his american handlers , asking them , " why did n't you just ask dr . goddard ?

in 1762 , george iii acquired buckingham house and it was enlarged over the next 75 years . during the 18th century , london was dogged by crime , and the bow street runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force . in total , more than 200 offences were punishable by death , including petty theft . most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday . the coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas , with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available ; and fleet street became the centre of the british press .
reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication . literary analysis of it is sparse , considering the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education . author mary mcdonough murphy , who collected individual impressions of to kill a mockingbird by several authors and public figures , calls the book , " an astonishing phenomenon " . in 2006 , british librarians ranked the book ahead of the bible as one " every adult should read before they die " . it was adapted into an oscar-winning film in 1962 by director robert mulligan , with a screenplay by horton foote . since 1990 , a play based on the novel has been performed annually in harper lee 's hometown of monroeville , alabama .
regulation of hunting within the united states dates from the 19th century . some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of theodore roosevelt and the boone and crockett club . local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as ducks unlimited , pheasants forever , or the delta waterfowl foundation . many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .

the most dense rail network in europe of 5,063 km ( 3,146 mi ) carries over 350 million passengers annually . in 2007 , each swiss citizen travelled on average 2,258 km ( 1,403 mi ) by rail , which makes them the keenest rail users . the network is administered mainly by the federal railways , except in graubünden , where the 366 km ( 227 mi ) narrow gauge railway is operated by the rhaetian railways and includes some world heritage lines . the building of new railway base tunnels through the alps is under way to reduce the time of travel between north and south through the alptransit project .
in 1979 , the japanese state broadcaster nhk first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio . the system , known as hi-vision or muse after its multiple sub-nyquist sampling encoding for encoding the signal , required about twice the bandwidth of the existing ntsc system but provided about four times the resolution ( 1080i/1125 lines ) . satellite test broadcasts started in 1989 , with regular testing starting in 1991 and regular broadcasting of bs-9ch commencing on november 25 , 1994 , which featured commercial and nhk programming .

australia had been shocked by the speedy collapse of british malaya and fall of singapore in which around 15,000 australian soldiers became prisoners of war . curtin predicted that the " battle for australia " would now follow . the japanese established a major base in the australian territory of new guinea in early 1942 . on 19 february , darwin suffered a devastating air raid , the first time the australian mainland had been attacked . over the following 19 months , australia was attacked from the air almost 100 times .
the second great awakening began around 1790 . it gained momentum by 1800 . after 1820 , membership rose rapidly among baptist and methodist congregations , whose preachers led the movement . it was past its peak by the late 1840s . it has been described as a reaction against skepticism , deism , and rationalism , although why those forces became pressing enough at the time to spark revivals is not fully understood . it enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations .
the " general law of linguistic rights of the indigenous peoples " grants all indigenous languages spoken in mexico , regardless of the number of speakers , the same validity as spanish in all territories in which they are spoken , and indigenous peoples are entitled to request some public services and documents in their native languages . along with spanish , the law has granted them — more than 60 languages — the status of " national languages " . the law includes all indigenous languages of the americas regardless of origin ; that is , it includes the indigenous languages of ethnic groups non-native to the territory . as such the national commission for the development of indigenous peoples recognizes the language of the kickapoo , who immigrated from the united states , and recognizes the languages of the guatemalan indigenous refugees . the mexican government has promoted and established bilingual primary and secondary education in some indigenous rural communities . nonetheless , of the indigenous peoples in mexico , only about 67 % of them ( or 5.4 % of the country 's population ) speak an indigenous language and about a sixth do not speak spanish ( 1.2 % of the country 's population ) .
the dry lands of namibia were inhabited since early times by san , damara , and namaqua , and since about the 14th century ad by immigrating bantu who came with the bantu expansion . most of the territory became a german imperial protectorate in 1884 and remained a german colony until the end of world war i . in 1920 , the league of nations mandated the country to south africa , which imposed its laws and , from 1948 , its apartheid policy . the port of walvis bay and the offshore penguin islands had been annexed by the cape colony under the british crown by 1878 and had become an integral part of the new union of south africa at its creation in 1910 .
this clash of opinions has sparked much controversy . for example , during the drafting of the european constitution in 2004 , the spanish government supplied the eu with translations of the text into basque , galician , catalan , and valencian , but the latter two were identical .
kurita passed through san bernardino strait at 03:00 on 25 october and headed along the coast of samar . the only thing standing in his path were three groups ( taffy 1 , 2 and 3 ) of the seventh fleet , commanded by admiral thomas kinkaid . each group had six escort carriers , with a total of more than 500 planes , and seven or eight destroyers or destroyer escorts ( de ) . kinkaid still believed that lee 's force was guarding the north , so the japanese had the element of surprise when they attacked taffy 3 at 06:45 . kurita mistook the taffy carriers for large fleet carriers and thought he had the whole third fleet in his sights . since escort carriers stood little chance against a battleship , adm. clifton sprague directed the carriers of taffy 3 to turn and flee eastward , hoping that bad visibility would reduce the accuracy of japanese gunfire , and used his destroyers to divert the japanese battleships . the destroyers made harassing torpedo attacks against the japanese . for ten minutes yamato was caught up in evasive action . two u.s. destroyers and a de were sunk , but they had bought enough time for the taffy groups to launch planes . taffy 3 turned and fled south , with shells scoring hits on some of its carriers and sinking one of them . the superior speed of the japanese force allowed it to draw closer and fire on the other two taffy groups . however , at 09:20 kurita suddenly turned and retreated north . signals had disabused him of the notion that he was attacking the third fleet , and the longer kurita continued to engage , the greater the risk of major air strikes . destroyer attacks had broken the japanese formations , shattering tactical control . three of kurita 's heavy cruisers had been sunk and another was too damaged to continue the fight . the japanese retreated through the san bernardino strait , under continuous air attack . the battle of leyte gulf was over ; and a large part of the japanese surface fleet destroyed .
the issue of the parentage of jesus in the talmud affects also the view of his mother . however the talmud does not mention mary by name and is considerate rather than only polemic . the story about panthera is also found in the toledot yeshu , the literary origins of which can not be traced with any certainty and given that it is unlikely to go before the 4th century , it is far too late to include authentic remembrances of jesus . the blackwell companion to jesus states that the toledot yeshu has no historical facts as such , and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to christianity . the name panthera may be a distortion of the term parthenos ( virgin ) and raymond e. brown considers the story of panthera a fanciful explanation of the birth of jesus which includes very little historical evidence . robert van voorst states that given that toledot yeshu is a medieval document and due to its lack of a fixed form and orientation towards a popular audience , it is " most unlikely " to have reliable historical information .
in june 1963 , rev . martin luther king , jr. gave a major speech in detroit that foreshadowed his " i have a dream " speech in washington , d.c. two months later . while the african-american civil rights movement gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965 , longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner city black youth wanting change . longstanding tensions in detroit culminated in the twelfth street riot in july 1967 . governor george w. romney ordered the michigan national guard into detroit , and president johnson sent in u.s. army troops . the result was 43 dead , 467 injured , over 7,200 arrests , and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed , mostly in black residential and business areas . thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods . the affected district lay in ruins for decades . it was the most costly riot in the united states .
the carboniferous was a time of active mountain building , as the supercontinent pangea came together . the southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent gondwana , which collided with north america-europe ( laurussia ) along the present line of eastern north america . this continental collision resulted in the hercynian orogeny in europe , and the alleghenian orogeny in north america ; it also extended the newly uplifted appalachians southwestward as the ouachita mountains . in the same time frame , much of present eastern eurasian plate welded itself to europe along the line of the ural mountains . there were two major oceans in the carboniferous the panthalassa and paleo-tethys . other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the rheic ocean ( closed by the assembly of south and north america ) , the small , shallow ural ocean ( which was closed by the collision of baltica , and siberia continents , creating the ural mountains ) and proto-tethys ocean .
cairo university is ranked as 401-500 according to the academic ranking of world universities ( shanghai ranking ) and 551-600 according to qs world university rankings . american university in cairo is ranked as 360 according to qs world university rankings and al-azhar university , alexandria university and ain shams university fall in the 701+ range . egypt is currently opening new research institutes for the aim of modernising research in the nation , the most recent example of which is zewail city of science and technology .
there are several major exceptions on tuition fees . in many european countries , it is possible to study without tuition fees . public universities in nordic countries were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005 . denmark , sweden and finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students . citizens of eu and eea member states and citizens from switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees , and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact .
the times is a british daily national newspaper based in london . it began in 1785 under the title the daily universal register and became the times on 1 january 1788 . the times and its sister paper the sunday times ( founded in 1821 ) are published by times newspapers , since 1981 a subsidiary of news uk , itself wholly owned by the news corp group headed by rupert murdoch . the times and the sunday times do not share editorial staff , were founded independently and have only had common ownership since 1967 .
in april 2009 , the united states supreme court agreed to hear a suit over reverse discrimination brought by 18 white firefighters against the city . the suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the new haven fire department . after the tests were scored , no black firefighters scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion , so the city announced that no one would be promoted . in the subsequent ricci v. destefano decision the court found 5-4 that new haven 's decision to ignore the test results violated title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 . as a result , a district court subsequently ordered the city to promote 14 of the white firefighters .
oklahoma city has a very active severe weather season from march through june , especially during april and may . being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as tornado alley , it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes , as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes . tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn , especially october . the oklahoma city metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world , with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890 . since the time weather records have been kept , oklahoma city has been struck by thirteen violent tornadoes , eleven f/ef4s and two f/ef5 . on may 3 , 1999 parts of southern oklahoma city and nearby suburban communities suffered from one of the most powerful tornadoes on record , an f5 on the fujita scale , with wind speeds estimated by radar at 318 mph ( 510 km/h ) . on may 20 , 2013 , far southwest oklahoma city , along with newcastle and moore , was hit again by a ef5 tornado ; it was 0.5 to 1.3 miles ( 0.80 to 2.09 km ) wide and killed 23 people . less than two weeks later , on may 31 , another outbreak affected the oklahoma city area , including an ef1 and an ef0 within the city and a tornado several miles west of the city that was 2.6 miles ( 4.2 km ) in width , the widest tornado ever recorded .
from 1842 onwards , chopin showed signs of serious illness . after a solo recital in paris on 21 february 1842 , he wrote to grzymała : " i have to lie in bed all day long , my mouth and tonsils are aching so much . " he was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the beethoven seventh symphony arrangement at erard 's on 1 march 1843 . late in 1844 , charles hallé visited chopin and found him " hardly able to move , bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain " , although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor . chopin 's health continued to deteriorate , particularly from this time onwards . modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses , he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy .
in their attempt to ensure white supremacy decades after emancipation , in the early 20th century , most southern states created laws based on the one-drop rule , defining as black , persons with any known african ancestry . this was a stricter interpretation than what had prevailed in the 19th century ; it ignored the many mixed families in the state and went against commonly accepted social rules of judging a person by appearance and association . some courts called it " the traceable amount rule . " anthropologists called it an example of a hypodescent rule , meaning that racially mixed persons were assigned the status of the socially subordinate group .
howard differed from his labor predecessor paul keating in that he supported traditional australian institutions like the monarchy in australia , the commemoration of anzac day and the design of the australian flag , but like keating he pursued privatisation of public utilities and the introduction of a broad based consumption tax ( although keating had dropped support for a gst by the time of his 1993 election victory ) . howard 's premiership coincided with al qaeda 's 11 september attacks on the united states . the howard government invoked the anzus treaty in response to the attacks and supported america 's campaigns in afghanistan and iraq .
the city council of the city of bern decided against having twinned cities except for a temporary ( during the uefa euro 2008 ) cooperation with the austrian city salzburg

on december 12 , the supreme soviet of the russian sfsr formally ratified the belavezha accords and renounced the 1922 union treaty . the russian deputies were also recalled from the supreme soviet of the ussr . the legality of this action was questionable , since soviet law did not allow a republic to unilaterally recall its deputies . however , no one in either russia or the kremlin objected . any objections from the latter would have likely had no effect , since the soviet government had effectively been rendered impotent long before december . in effect , the largest and most powerful republic had seceded from the union . later that day , gorbachev hinted for the first time that he was considering stepping down .

the army employs various individual weapons to provide light firepower at short ranges . the most common weapons used by the army are the compact variant of the m16 rifle , the m4 carbine , as well as the 7.62×51mm variant of the fn scar for army rangers . the primary sidearm in the u.s. army is the 9 mm m9 pistol ; the m11 pistol is also used . both handguns are to be replaced through the modular handgun system program . soldiers are also equiped with various hand grenades , such as the m67 fragmentation grenade and m18 smoke grenade .
the jawa dwipa hindu kingdom in java and sumatra existed around 200 bce . the history of the malay-speaking world began with the advent of indian influence , which dates back to at least the 3rd century bce . indian traders came to the archipelago both for its abundant forest and maritime products and to trade with merchants from china , who also discovered the malay world at an early date . both hinduism and buddhism were well established in the malay peninsula by the beginning of the 1st century ce , and from there spread across the archipelago .
the " radical enlightenment " promoted the concept of separating church and state , an idea that often credited to english philosopher john locke ( 1632–1704 ) . according to his principle of the social contract , locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience , as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control . for locke , this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience , which he said must therefore remain protected from any government authority .
renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources . as the cost of renewable power falls , the scope of economically viable applications increases . renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity . where " oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source ( e.g . on islands , off-grid and in some countries ) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today " . as of 2012 , renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally . in 2011 , additions included 41 gigawatt ( gw ) of new wind power capacity , 30 gw of pv , 25 gw of hydro-electricity , 6 gw of biomass , 0.5 gw of csp , and 0.1 gw of geothermal power .
mobile telecommunications and radio broadcasting help to fight corruption , especially in developing regions like africa , where other forms of communications are limited . in india , the anti-corruption bureau fights against corruption , and a new ombudsman bill called jan lokpal bill is being prepared .
perhaps , his most notable letter was his festal letter , written to his church in alexandria when he was in exile , as he could not be in their presence . this letter shows clearly his stand that accepting jesus is the divine son of god is not optional but necessary ; " i know moreover that not only this thing saddens you , but also the fact that while others have obtained the churches by violence , you are meanwhile cast out from your places . for they hold the places , but you the apostolic faith . they are , it is true , in the places , but outside of the true faith ; while you are outside the places indeed , but the faith , within you . let us consider whether is the greater , the place or the faith . clearly the true faith . who then has lost more , or who possesses more ? he who holds the place , or he who holds the faith ?
although the drive moved to massachusetts for the 1994 season , the afl had a number of other teams which it considered " dynasties " , including the tampa bay storm ( the only team that has existed in some form for all twenty-eight contested seasons ) , their arch-rival the orlando predators , the now-defunct san jose sabercats of the present decade , and their rivals the arizona rattlers .
atari games created a line of nes products under the name tengen and took a different approach . the company attempted to reverse engineer the lockout chip to develop its own " rabbit " chip . however , tengen also obtained a description of the lockout chip from the united states patent and trademark office by falsely claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims in a legal case . nintendo sued tengen for copyright infringement , which tengen lost as it could not prove that the legally obtained patent documents had not been used by the reverse engineering team . tengen 's antitrust claims against nintendo were never finally decided .
between october 14–16 , 1964 , leonid brezhnev and a small cadre of high-ranking communist party officials , deposed khrushchev as soviet government leader a day after voskhod 1 landed , in what was called the " wednesday conspiracy " . the new political leaders , along with korolev , ended the technologically troublesome voskhod program , cancelling voskhod 3 and 4 , which were in the planning stages , and started concentrating on the race to the moon . voskhod 2 would end up being korolev 's final achievement before his death on january 14 , 1966 , as it would become the last of the many space firsts that demonstrated the ussr 's domination in spacecraft technology during the early 1960s . according to historian asif siddiqi , korolev 's accomplishments marked " the absolute zenith of the soviet space program , one never , ever attained since . " there would be a two-year pause in soviet piloted space flights while voskhod 's replacement , the soyuz spacecraft , was designed and developed .
the chemical composition of wood varies from species to species , but is approximately 50 % carbon , 42 % oxygen , 6 % hydrogen , 1 % nitrogen , and 1 % other elements ( mainly calcium , potassium , sodium , magnesium , iron , and manganese ) by weight . wood also contains sulfur , chlorine , silicon , phosphorus , and other elements in small quantity .
in 1970 , the new haven black panther trials took place , the largest and longest trials in connecticut history . black panther party co-founder bobby seale and ten other party members were tried for murdering an alleged informant . beginning on may day , the city became a center of protest for 12,000 panther supporters , college students , and new left activists ( including jean genet , benjamin spock , abbie hoffman , jerry rubin , and john froines ) , who amassed on the new haven green , across the street from where the trials were being held . violent confrontations between the demonstrators and the new haven police occurred , and several bombs were set off in the area by radicals . the event became a rallying point for the new left and critics of the nixon administration .
northwestern was elected to the association of american universities in 1917 and remains a research university with " very high " research activity . northwestern 's schools of management , engineering , and communication are among the most academically productive in the nation . northwestern received $ 550 million in research funding in 2014 . northwestern supports nearly 1,500 research laboratories across two campuses , predominately in the medical and biological sciences . through the innovation and new ventures office ( invo ) , northwestern researchers disclosed 247 inventions , filed 270 patents applications , received 81 foreign and us patents , started 12 companies , and generated $ 79.8 million in licensing revenue in 2013 . the bulk of revenue has come from a patent on pregabalin , a synthesized organic molecule discovered by chemistry professor richard silverman , which ultimately was marketed as lyrica , a drug sold by pfizer , to combat epilepsy , neuropathic pain , and fibromyalgia . invo has been involved in creating a number of centers , including the center for developmental therapeutics ( cdt ) and the center for device development ( cd2 ) . it has also helped form over 50 northwestern startup companies based on northwestern technologies .
in physics , whitehead 's thought has had some influence . he articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to einstein 's general relativity , see whitehead 's theory of gravitation . it has been severely criticized . yutaka tanaka , who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings , proposes that einstein 's work does not actually refute whitehead 's formulation . whitehead 's view has now been rendered obsolete , with the discovery of gravitational waves . they are phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that whitehead assumes . consequently , whitehead 's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation , and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry , minkowskian in particular , as an often-locally-adequate approximation . an exact replacement of whitehead 's cosmology would need to admit a riemannian geometry . also , although whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory , his metaphysics of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field . henry stapp and david bohm are among those whose work has been influenced by whitehead .
the richmond area also has two railroad stations served by amtrak . each station receives regular service from north of richmond including washington , d.c. , philadelphia , and new york . the suburban staples mill road station is located on a major north-south freight line and receives all service to and from all points south including , raleigh , durham , savannah , newport news , williamsburg and florida . richmond 's only railway station located within the city limits , the historic main street station , was renovated in 2004 . as of 2010 , the station only receives trains headed to and from newport news and williamsburg due to track layout . as a result , the staples mill road station receives more trains and serves more passengers overall .
sanskrit linguist madhav deshpande says that when the term " sanskrit " arose it was not thought of as a specific language set apart from other languages , but rather as a particularly refined or perfected manner of speaking . knowledge of sanskrit was a marker of social class and educational attainment in ancient india , and the language was taught mainly to members of the higher castes through the close analysis of vyākaraṇins such as pāṇini and patanjali , who exhorted proper sanskrit at all times , especially during ritual . sanskrit , as the learned language of ancient india , thus existed alongside the vernacular prakrits , which were middle indo-aryan languages . however , linguistic change led to an eventual loss of mutual intelligibility .
when their migratory movements ended , there appeared among the slavs the first rudiments of state organizations , each headed by a prince with a treasury and a defense force . moreover , it was the beginnings of class differentiation , and nobles pledged allegiance either to the frankish/ holy roman emperors or the byzantine emperors .
previous post-furman mass clemencies took place in 1986 in new mexico , when governor toney anaya commuted all death sentences because of his personal opposition to the death penalty . in 1991 , outgoing ohio governor dick celeste commuted the sentences of eight prisoners , among them all four women on the state 's death row . and during his two terms ( 1979–1987 ) as florida 's governor , bob graham , although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-furman involuntary execution as well as 15 others , agreed to commute the sentences of six people on the grounds of " possible innocence " or " disproportionality . "
in the uk , the london , brighton and south coast railway pioneered overhead electrification of its suburban lines in london , london bridge to victoria being opened to traffic on 1 december 1909 . victoria to crystal palace via balham and west norwood opened in may 1911 . peckham rye to west norwood opened in june 1912 . further extensions were not made owing to the first world war . two lines opened in 1925 under the southern railway serving coulsdon north and sutton railway station . the lines were electrified at 6.7 kv 25 hz . it was announced in 1926 that all lines were to be converted to dc third rail and the last overhead electric service ran in september 1929 .
argentina : the torch relay leg in buenos aires , argentina , held on april 11 , began with an artistic show at the lola mora amphitheatre in costanera sur . in the end of the show the mayor of buenos aires mauricio macri gave the torch to the first torchbearer , carlos espínola . the leg finished at the buenos aires riding club in the palermo district , the last torchbearer being gabriela sabatini . the 13.8 km route included landmarks like the obelisk and plaza de mayo . the day was marked by several pro-tibet protests , which included a giant banner reading " free tibet " , and an alternative " human rights torch " that was lit by protesters and paraded along the route the flame was to take . most of these protests were peaceful in nature , and the torch was not impeded . chinese immigrants also turned out in support of the games , but only minor scuffles were reported between both groups . runners surrounded by rows of security carried the olympic flame past thousands of jubilant argentines in the most trouble-free torch relay in nearly a week . people showered the parade route with confetti as banks , government offices and businesses took an impromptu half-day holiday for the only latin american stop on the flame 's five-continent journey .
since 1934 , the sale of federal duck stamps has generated $ 670 million , and helped to purchase or lease 5,200,000 acres ( 8,100 sq mi ; 21,000 km2 ) of habitat . the stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds , an entrance pass for all national wildlife refuge areas , and are also considered collectors items often purchased for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities . although non-hunters buy a significant number of duck stamps , eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters , which is logical , as hunters are required to purchase them . distribution of funds is managed by the migratory bird conservation commission ( mbcc ) .
at the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the centre room behind its glass doors . this is a chinese-style saloon enhanced by queen mary , who , working with the designer sir charles allom , created a more " binding " chinese theme in the late 1920s , although the lacquer doors were brought from brighton in 1873 . running the length of the piano nobile of the east wing is the great gallery , modestly known as the principal corridor , which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle . it has mirrored doors , and mirrored cross walls reflecting porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from brighton . the chinese luncheon room and yellow drawing room are situated at each end of this gallery , with the centre room obviously placed in the centre .
mali faces numerous health challenges related to poverty , malnutrition , and inadequate hygiene and sanitation . mali 's health and development indicators rank among the worst in the world . life expectancy at birth is estimated to be 53.06 years in 2012 . in 2000 , 62–65 percent of the population was estimated to have access to safe drinking water and only 69 percent to sanitation services of some kind . in 2001 , the general government expenditures on health totalled about us $ 4 per capita at an average exchange rate .
microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease . in a microbial culture , a growth medium is provided for a specific agent . a sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium . most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar , a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium , along with copious amounts of water . a single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony , which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a " lawn " . the size , color , shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species , its specific genetic makeup ( its strain ) , and the environment that supports its growth . other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification . plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others , or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others . bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium . microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses : the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect , and then alter or kill . in the case of viral identification , a region of dead cells results from viral growth , and is called a " plaque " . eukaryotic parasites may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent .
during the later stages of world war ii , the entire cold war , and to a lesser extent afterwards , uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons . initially , two major types of fission bombs were built : a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238 . later , a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ( thermonuclear weapon ) was built , that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion . such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile ( unenriched ) uranium case , and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process .
mechanically controlled variable capacitors allow the plate spacing to be adjusted , for example by rotating or sliding a set of movable plates into alignment with a set of stationary plates . low cost variable capacitors squeeze together alternating layers of aluminum and plastic with a screw . electrical control of capacitance is achievable with varactors ( or varicaps ) , which are reverse-biased semiconductor diodes whose depletion region width varies with applied voltage . they are used in phase-locked loops , amongst other applications .
kerry said on september 9 in response to a reporter 's question about whether syrian president bashar al-assad could avert a military strike : " he could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week . turn it over , all of it , without delay , and allow a full and total accounting for that . but he is n't about to do it , and it ca n't be done , obviously . " this unscripted remark initiated a process that would lead to syria agreeing to relinquish and destroy its chemical weapons arsenal , as russia treated kerry 's statement as a serious proposal . russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia would work " immediately " to convince syria relinquish and destroy its large chemical weapons arsenal . syria quickly welcomed this proposal and on september 14 , the un formally accepted syria 's application to join the convention banning chemical weapons , and separately , the u.s. and russia agreed on a plan to eliminate syria 's chemical weapons by the middle of 2014 . on september 28 , the un security council passed a resolution ordering the destruction of syria 's chemical weapons and condemning the august 21 ghouta attack .
french cuisine , west indian cuisine , creole cuisine , italian cuisine and asian cuisine are common in st. barthélemy . the island has over 70 restaurants serving many dishes and others are a significant number of gourmet restaurants ; many of the finest restaurants are located in the hotels . there are also a number of snack restaurants which the french call " les snacks " or " les petits creux " which include sandwiches , pizzas and salads . west indian cuisine , steamed vegetables with fresh fish is common ; creole dishes tend to be spicier . the island hosts gastronomic events throughout the year , with dishes such as spring roll of shrimp and bacon , fresh grilled lobster , chinese noodle salad with coconut milk , and grilled beef fillet etc .
one of the most prominent movies filmed in alaska is mgm 's eskimo/mala the magnificent , starring alaska native ray mala . in 1932 an expedition set out from mgm 's studios in hollywood to alaska to film what was then billed as " the biggest picture ever made . " upon arriving in alaska , they set up " camp hollywood " in northwest alaska , where they lived during the duration of the filming . louis b. mayer spared no expense in spite of the remote location , going so far as to hire the chef from the hotel roosevelt in hollywood to prepare meals .
the politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in mexico city since the second half of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country , whether with the support of the federal government—as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s—or through laws recently approved by the legislative assembly . in april of the same year , the legislative assembly expanded provisions on abortions , becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons , to permit it regardless of the reason should the mother request it before the twelfth week of pregnancy . in december 2009 , the federal district became the first city in latin america , and one of very few in the world , to legalize same-sex marriage .
the most common way for travellers to enter the country seems to be by air . according to the website lonely planet , getting into myanmar is problematic : " no bus or train service connects myanmar with another country , nor can you travel by car or motorcycle across the border – you must walk across . " , and states that , " it is not possible for foreigners to go to/from myanmar by sea or river . " there are a small number of border crossings that allow the passage of private vehicles , such as the border between ruili ( china ) to mu-se , the border between htee kee ( myanmar ) and ban phu nam ron ( thailand ) ( the most direct border between dawei and kanchanaburi ) , and the border between myawaddy ( myanmar ) and mae sot ( thailand ) . at least one tourist company has successfully run commercial overland routes through these borders since 2013 . " from mae sai ( thailand ) you can cross to tachileik , but can only go as far as kengtung . those in thailand on a visa run can cross to kawthaung but can not venture farther into myanmar . "
north carolina is home to three major league sports franchises : the carolina panthers of the national football league and the charlotte hornets of the national basketball association are based in charlotte , while the raleigh-based carolina hurricanes play in the national hockey league . the panthers and hurricanes are the only two major professional sports teams that have the same geographical designation while playing in different metropolitan areas . the hurricanes are the only major professional team from north carolina to have won a league championship , having captured the stanley cup in 2006 . north carolina is also home to charlotte hounds of the major league lacrosse .
in 1965 , paul vi decided on the creation of a joint working group with the world council of churches to map all possible avenues of dialogue and cooperation . in the following three years , eight sessions were held which resulted in many joint proposals . it was proposed to work closely together in areas of social justice and development and third world issues such as hunger and poverty . on the religious side , it was agreed to share together in the week of prayer for christian unity , to be held every year . the joint working group was to prepare texts which were to be used by all christians . on 19 july 1968 , the meeting of the world council of churches took place in uppsala , sweden , which pope paul called a sign of the times . he sent his blessing in an ecumenical manner : " may the lord bless everything you do for the case of christian unity . " the world council of churches decided on including catholic theologians in its committees , provided they have the backing of the vatican .
the daily northwestern is the main student newspaper . established in 1881 , and published on weekdays during the academic year , it is directed entirely by undergraduates . although it serves the northwestern community , the daily has no business ties to the university , being supported wholly by advertisers . it is owned by the students publishing company . north by northwestern is an online undergraduate magazine , having been established in september 2006 by students at the medill school of journalism . published on weekdays , it consists of updates on news stories and special events inserted throughout the day and on weekends . north by northwestern also publishes a quarterly print magazine . syllabus is the undergraduate yearbook . first published in 1885 , the yearbook is an epitome of that year 's events at northwestern . published by students publishing company and edited by northwestern students , it is distributed in late may . northwestern flipside is an undergraduate satirical magazine . founded in 2009 , the flipside publishes a weekly issue both in print and online . helicon is the university 's undergraduate literary magazine . started in 1979 , it is published twice a year , a web issue in the winter , and a print issue with a web complement in the spring . the protest is northwestern 's quarterly social justice magazine . the northwestern division of student multicultural affairs also supports publications such as nuasian , a magazine and blog about asian and asian-american culture and the issues facing asians and asian-americans , ahora , a magazine about hispanic and latino/a culture and campus life , blackboard magazine about african-american life , and al bayan published by the northwestern muslim-cultural student association .
the new haven green is the site of many free music concerts , especially during the summer months . these have included the new haven symphony orchestra , the july free concerts on the green in july , and the new haven jazz festival in august . the jazz festival , which began in 1982 , is one of the longest-running free outdoor festivals in the u.s. , until it was canceled for 2007 . headliners such as the breakfast , dave brubeck , ray charles and celia cruz have historically drawn 30,000 to 50,000 fans , filling up the new haven green to capacity . the new haven jazz festival was revived in 2008 and has been sponsored since by jazz haven .
the taiping rebellion in the mid-19th century was the first major instance of anti-manchu sentiment threatening the stability of the dynasty . hong xiuquan , a failed civil service candidate , led the taiping rebellion , amid widespread social unrest and worsening famine . in 1851 hong xiuquan and others launched an uprising in guizhou province , established the taiping heavenly kingdom with hong himself as king , claiming he often had visions of god and that he was the brother of jesus christ . slavery , concubinage , arranged marriage , opium smoking , footbinding , judicial torture , and the worship of idols were all banned . however , success and subsequent authority and power led to internal feuds , defections and corruption . in addition , british and french troops , equipped with modern weapons , had come to the assistance of the qing imperial army . it was not until 1864 that qing armies under zeng guofan succeeded in crushing the revolt . the rebellion not only posed the most serious threat towards qing rulers ; it was also " bloodiest civil war of all time . " between 20 and 30 million people died during its fourteen-year course from 1850 to 1864 . after the outbreak of this rebellion , there were also revolts by the muslims and miao people of china against the qing dynasty , most notably in the dungan revolt ( 1862–77 ) in the northwest and the panthay rebellion ( 1856–1873 ) in yunnan .
czech ( /ˈtʃɛk/ ; čeština czech pronunciation : [ ˈt͡ʃɛʃcɪna ] ) , formerly known as bohemian ( /boʊˈhiːmiən , bə-/ ; lingua bohemica in latin ) , is a west slavic language strongly influenced by latin and german language , spoken by over 10 million people and it is the official language of the czech republic . czech 's closest relative is slovak , with which it is mutually intelligible . it is closely related to other west slavic languages , such as silesian and polish . although most czech vocabulary is based on shared roots with slavic , romance , and germanic languages , many loanwords ( most associated with high culture ) have been adopted in recent years .
the story sees bond pitted against the global criminal organisation spectre , marking the group 's first appearance in an eon productions film since 1971 's diamonds are forever , [ n 2 ] and tying craig 's series of films together with an overarching storyline . several recurring james bond characters , including m , q and eve moneypenny return , with the new additions of léa seydoux as dr. madeleine swann , dave bautista as mr. hinx , andrew scott as max denbigh and monica bellucci as lucia sciarra .
the alps are split into five climatic zones , each with different vegetation . the climate , plant life and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains . the lowest zone is the colline zone , which exists between 500 and 1,000 m ( 1,640 and 3,281 ft ) , depending on the location . the montane zone extends from 800 to 1,700 m ( 2,625 to 5,577 ft ) , followed by the sub-alpine zone from 1,600 to 2,400 m ( 5,249 to 7,874 ft ) . the alpine zone , extending from tree line to snow line , is followed by the glacial zone , which covers the glaciated areas of the mountain . climatic conditions show variances within the same zones ; for example , weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley , extending directly from the peaks , are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall .
binary compounds of zinc are known for most of the metalloids and all the nonmetals except the noble gases . the oxide zno is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions , but is amphoteric , dissolving in both strong basic and acidic solutions . the other chalcogenides ( zns , znse , and znte ) have varied applications in electronics and optics . pnictogenides ( zn 3n 2 , zn 3p 2 , zn 3as 2 and zn 3sb 2 ) , the peroxide ( zno 2 ) , the hydride ( znh 2 ) , and the carbide ( znc 2 ) are also known . of the four halides , znf 2 has the most ionic character , whereas the others ( zncl 2 , znbr 2 , and zni 2 ) have relatively low melting points and are considered to have more covalent character .
according to the united states census bureau , the city has a total area of 656.3 square miles ( 1,700 km2 ) ; this comprises 634.0 square miles ( 1,642 km2 ) of land and 22.3 square miles ( 58 km2 ) of water . the piney woods is north of houston . most of houston is located on the gulf coastal plain , and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest . much of the city was built on forested land , marshes , swamp , or prairie which resembles the deep south , and are all still visible in surrounding areas . flatness of the local terrain , when combined with urban sprawl , has made flooding a recurring problem for the city . downtown stands about 50 feet ( 15 m ) above sea level , and the highest point in far northwest houston is about 125 feet ( 38 m ) in elevation . the city once relied on groundwater for its needs , but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground-level water sources such as lake houston , lake conroe and lake livingston . the city owns surface water rights for 1.20 billion gallons of water a day in addition to 150 million gallons a day worth of groundwater .
kerry and his second wife , mozambican-born businesswoman and philanthropist maria teresa thierstein simões ferreira ( known as teresa ) , the widow of kerry 's late pennsylvania republican senate colleague henry john heinz iii , were introduced to each other by heinz at an earth day rally in 1990 . early the following year , senator heinz was killed in a plane crash near lower merion . teresa has three sons from her previous marriage to heinz , henry john heinz iv , andré thierstein heinz , and christopher drake heinz . heinz and kerry were married on may 26 , 1995 , in nantucket , massachusetts .
oklahoma had 598 incorporated places in 2010 , including four cities over 100,000 in population and 43 over 10,000 . two of the fifty largest cities in the united states are located in oklahoma , oklahoma city and tulsa , and 65 percent of oklahomans live within their metropolitan areas , or spheres of economic and social influence defined by the united states census bureau as a metropolitan statistical area . oklahoma city , the state 's capital and largest city , had the largest metropolitan area in the state in 2010 , with 1,252,987 people , and the metropolitan area of tulsa had 937,478 residents . between 2000 and 2010 , the cities that led the state in population growth were blanchard ( 172.4 % ) , elgin ( 78.2 % ) , jenks ( 77.0 % ) , piedmont ( 56.7 % ) , bixby ( 56.6 % ) , and owasso ( 56.3 % ) .
sikhism is practiced primarily in gurudwara at kupundole . an earlier temple of sikhism is also present in kathmandu which is now defunct . jainism is practiced by a small community . a jain temple is present in gyaneshwar , where jains practice their faith . according to the records of the spiritual assembly of the baha'is of nepal , there are approximately 300 baha'is in kathmandu valley . they have a national office located in shantinagar , baneshwor . the baha'is also have classes for children at the national centre and other localities in kathmandu . islam is practised in kathmandu but muslims are a minority , accounting for about 4.2 % of the population of nepal . [ citation needed ] it is said that in kathmandu alone there are 170 christian churches . christian missionary hospitals , welfare organizations , and schools are also operating . nepali citizens who served as soldiers in indian and british armies , who had converted to christianity while in service , on return to nepal continue to practice their religion . they have contributed to the spread of christianity and the building of churches in nepal and in kathmandu , in particular .
though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for irish traditional music , virtually all irish players prefer flat-backed instruments with oval sound holes to the italian-style bowl-back mandolins or the carved-top mandolins with f-holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists . the former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session ( as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player 's lap ) , whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear . the f-hole mandolin , however , does come into its own in a traditional session , where its brighter tone cuts through the sonic clutter of a pub . greatly preferred for formal performance and recording are flat-topped " irish-style " mandolins ( reminiscent of the wwi-era martin army-navy mandolin ) and carved ( arch ) top mandolins with oval soundholes , such as the gibson a-style of the 1920s .
writing to a friend in may 1795 , burke surveyed the causes of discontent : " i think i can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of protestant ascendency , as they affect ireland ; or of indianism [ i.e . corporate tyranny , as practiced by the british east indies company ] , as they affect these countries , and as they affect asia ; or of jacobinism , as they affect all europe , and the state of human society itself . the last is the greatest evil " . by march 1796 , however burke had changed his mind : " our government and our laws are beset by two different enemies , which are sapping its foundations , indianism , and jacobinism . in some cases they act separately , in some they act in conjunction : but of this i am sure ; that the first is the worst by far , and the hardest to deal with ; and for this amongst other reasons , that it weakens discredits , and ruins that force , which ought to be employed with the greatest credit and energy against the other ; and that it furnishes jacobinism with its strongest arms against all formal government " .
the south american highlands were a center of early agriculture . genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species suggests that the potato has a single origin in the area of southern peru , from a species in the solanum brevicaule complex . over 99 % of all modern cultivated potatoes worldwide are descendants of a subspecies indigenous to south-central chile , solanum tuberosum ssp . tuberosum , where it was cultivated as long as 10,000 years ago . according to george raudzens , " it is clear that in pre-columbian times some groups struggled to survive and often suffered food shortages and famines , while others enjoyed a varied and substantial diet . " the persistent drought around 850 ad coincided with the collapse of classic maya civilization , and the famine of one rabbit ( ad 1454 ) was a major catastrophe in mexico .
surface-mount technology emerged in the 1960s , gained momentum in the early 1980s and became widely used by the mid-1990s . components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the pcb surface , instead of wire leads to pass through holes . components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting , allowing much smaller pcb assemblies with much higher circuit densities . surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation , reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates . components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes . surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components , and passive components much cheaper ; prices of semiconductor surface mount devices ( smds ) are determined more by the chip itself than the package , with little price advantage over larger packages . some wire-ended components , such as 1n4148 small-signal switch diodes , are actually significantly cheaper than smd equivalents .
holometabolism , or complete metamorphosis , is where the insect changes in four stages , an egg or embryo , a larva , a pupa and the adult or imago . in these species , an egg hatches to produce a larva , which is generally worm-like in form . this worm-like form can be one of several varieties : eruciform ( caterpillar-like ) , scarabaeiform ( grub-like ) , campodeiform ( elongated , flattened and active ) , elateriform ( wireworm-like ) or vermiform ( maggot-like ) . the larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa , a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon . there are three types of pupae : obtect , exarate or coarctate . obtect pupae are compact , with the legs and other appendages enclosed . exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended . coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin . :151 insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage , and emerge as adults . butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis , although most insects use this life cycle . some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis .
as a result , in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc . led by engineers kees schouhamer immink and toshitada doi , the research pushed forward laser and optical disc technology . after a year of experimentation and discussion , the task force produced the red book cd-da standard . first published in 1980 , the standard was formally adopted by the iec as an international standard in 1987 , with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996 .
the development of skyscrapers over 300 feet ( 91 m ) in san diego is attributed to the construction of the el cortez hotel in 1927 , the tallest building in the city from 1927 to 1963 . as time went on multiple buildings claimed the title of san diego 's tallest skyscraper , including the union bank of california building and symphony towers . currently the tallest building in san diego is one america plaza , standing 500 feet ( 150 m ) tall , which was completed in 1991 . the downtown skyline contains no super-talls , as a regulation put in place by the federal aviation administration in the 1970s set a 500 feet ( 152 m ) limit on the height of buildings due to the proximity of san diego international airport . an iconic description of the skyline includes its skyscrapers being compared to the tools of a toolbox .
in classical physics , an inertial reference frame is one in which an object that experiences no forces does not accelerate . in general relativity , an inertial frame of reference is one that is following a geodesic of space-time . an object that moves against a geodesic experiences a force . an object in free fall does not experience a force , because it is following a geodesic . an object standing on the earth , however , will experience a force , as it is being held against the geodesic by the surface of the planet . in light of this , the bucket of water rotating in empty space will experience a force because it rotates with respect to the geodesic . the water will become concave , not because it is rotating with respect to the distant stars , but because it is rotating with respect to the geodesic .
the u.s. senate passed a reform bill in may 2010 , following the house which passed a bill in december 2009 . these bills must now be reconciled . the new york times provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills , which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the obama administration . for instance , the volcker rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation , though in the senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades .
natives of north america began practicing farming approximately 4,000 years ago , late in the archaic period of north american cultures . technology had advanced to the point that pottery was becoming common and the small-scale felling of trees had become feasible . concurrently , the archaic indians began using fire in a controlled manner . intentional burning of vegetation was used to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories . it made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants , which were important for both food and medicines .
since at least the time of the ancient greeks , a proportion of jews have assimilated into the wider non-jewish society around them , by either choice or force , ceasing to practice judaism and losing their jewish identity . assimilation took place in all areas , and during all time periods , with some jewish communities , for example the kaifeng jews of china , disappearing entirely . the advent of the jewish enlightenment of the 18th century ( see haskalah ) and the subsequent emancipation of the jewish populations of europe and america in the 19th century , accelerated the situation , encouraging jews to increasingly participate in , and become part of , secular society . the result has been a growing trend of assimilation , as jews marry non-jewish spouses and stop participating in the jewish community .
a dense wave of smog began in the central and eastern part of china on 2 december 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) , including tianjin , hebei , shandong , jiangsu , anhui , shanghai and zhejiang . a lack of cold air flow , combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions , collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region . the heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern jiangsu province , especially in and around nanjing , with its aqi pollution index at " severely polluted " for five straight days and " heavily polluted " for nine . on 3 december 2013 , levels of pm2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre , falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 december 2013 . between 3:00 pm , 3 december and 2:00pm , 4 december local time , several expressways from nanjing to other jiangsu cities were closed , stranding dozens of passenger buses in zhongyangmen bus station . from 5 to 6 december , nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools . children 's hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent ; general incidence of bronchitis , pneumonia , upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased . the smog dissipated 12 december . officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind , automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure , and coal-powered district heating system in north china region . prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions ( mostly so2 ) towards china 's east coast .
late carboniferous and early permian insect orders include both extant groups , their stem groups , and a number of paleozoic groups , now extinct . during this era , some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70 cm ( 22 to 28 in ) , making them far larger than any living insect . this gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today . the lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor . most extinct orders of insects developed during the permian period that began around 270 million years ago . many of the early groups became extinct during the permian-triassic extinction event , the largest mass extinction in the history of the earth , around 252 million years ago .
new haven has been depicted in a number of movies . scenes in the film all about eve ( 1950 ) are set at the taft hotel ( now taft apartments ) on the corner of college and chapel streets , and the history of new haven theaters as broadway " tryouts " is depicted in the fred astaire film the band wagon ( 1953 ) . the city was fictionally portrayed in the steven spielberg movie amistad ( 1997 ) concerning the events around the mutiny trial of that ship 's rebelling captives . new haven was also fictionalized in the movie the skulls ( 2000 ) , which focused on conspiracy theories surrounding the real-life skull and bones secret society which is located in new haven .
the 2008 summer olympics torch relay was run from march 24 until august 8 , 2008 , prior to the 2008 summer olympics , with the theme of " one world , one dream " . plans for the relay were announced on april 26 , 2007 , in beijing , china . the relay , also called by the organizers as the " journey of harmony " , lasted 129 days and carried the torch 137,000 km ( 85,000 mi ) – the longest distance of any olympic torch relay since the tradition was started ahead of the 1936 summer olympics .
in manufacturing the glass bulb , a type of " ribbon machine " is used . a continuous ribbon of glass is passed along a conveyor belt , heated in a furnace , and then blown by precisely aligned air nozzles through holes in the conveyor belt into molds . thus the glass bulbs are created . after the bulbs are blown , and cooled , they are cut off the ribbon machine ; a typical machine of this sort produces 50,000 bulbs per hour . the filament and its supports are assembled on a glass stem , which is fused to the bulb . the air is pumped out of the bulb , and the evacuation tube in the stem press is sealed by a flame . the bulb is then inserted into the lamp base , and the whole assembly tested .
callaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978 when most opinion polls showed labour to have a narrow lead . however he decided to extend his wage restraint policy for another year hoping that the economy would be in a better shape for a 1979 election . but during the winter of 1978–79 there were widespread strikes among lorry drivers , railway workers , car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay-rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life . these events came to be dubbed the " winter of discontent " .
the number of species of flowering plants is estimated to be in the range of 250,000 to 400,000 . this compares to around 12,000 species of moss or 11,000 species of pteridophytes , showing that the flowering plants are much more diverse . the number of families in apg ( 1998 ) was 462 . in apg ii ( 2003 ) it is not settled ; at maximum it is 457 , but within this number there are 55 optional segregates , so that the minimum number of families in this system is 402 . in apg iii ( 2009 ) there are 415 families .
as one of the earliest centers of book-printing in europe ( see above : history ) , strasbourg for a long time held a large number of incunabula—documents printed before 1500—in her library as one of her most precious heritages . after the total destruction of this institution in 1870 , however , a new collection had to be reassembled from scratch . today , strasbourg 's different public and institutional libraries again display a sizable total number of incunabula , distributed as follows : bibliothèque nationale et universitaire , ca . 2 098 médiathèque de la ville et de la communauté urbaine de strasbourg , 394 bibliothèque du grand séminaire , 238 médiathèque protestante , 94 and bibliothèque alsatique du crédit mutuel , 5 .
during the nimrod expedition led by ernest shackleton in 1907 , parties led by edgeworth david became the first to climb mount erebus and to reach the south magnetic pole . douglas mawson , who assumed the leadership of the magnetic pole party on their perilous return , went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931 . in addition , shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in december 1908 – february 1909 : they were the first humans to traverse the ross ice shelf , the first to traverse the transantarctic mountains ( via the beardmore glacier ) , and the first to set foot on the south polar plateau . an expedition led by norwegian polar explorer roald amundsen from the ship fram became the first to reach the geographic south pole on 14 december 1911 , using a route from the bay of whales and up the axel heiberg glacier . one month later , the doomed scott expedition reached the pole .
the first wave of modern jewish migration to ottoman-ruled palestine , known as the first aliyah , began in 1881 , as jews fled pogroms in eastern europe . although the zionist movement already existed in practice , austro-hungarian journalist theodor herzl is credited with founding political zionism , a movement which sought to establish a jewish state in the land of israel , thus offering a solution to the so-called jewish question of the european states , in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time . in 1896 , herzl published der judenstaat ( the state of the jews ) , offering his vision of a future jewish state ; the following year he presided over the first zionist congress .
apple has generally dominated the premium pc market , having a 91 percent market share for pcs priced at more than $ 1,000 in 2009 , according to npd . the macintosh took 45 percent of operating profits in the pc industry during q4 2012 , compared to 13 percent for dell , seven percent for hewlett packard , six percent for lenovo and asus , and one percent for acer . while sales of the macintosh have largely held steady , in comparison to apple 's sales of the iphone and ipad which increased significantly during the 2010s , macintosh computers still enjoy high margins on a per unit basis , with the majority being their macbooks that are focused on the ultraportable niche that is the most profitable and only growing segment of pcs . it also helped that the macintosh lineup is simple , updated on a yearly schedule , and consistent across both apple retail stores , and authorized resellers where they have a special " store within a store " section to distinguish them from windows pcs . in contrast , windows pc manufacturers generally have a wide range of offerings , selling only a portion through retail with a full selection on the web , and often with limited-time or region-specific models . the macintosh ranked third on the " list of intended brands for desktop purchases " for the 2011 holiday season , then moved up to second in 2012 by displacing hewlett packard , and in 2013 took the top spot ahead of dell .
the crusades brought a shift in european trade routes that accelerated the decline of kievan rus ' . in 1204 the forces of the fourth crusade sacked constantinople , making the dnieper trade route marginal . at the same time the teutonic knights ( of the northern crusades ) were conquering the baltic region and threatening the lands of novgorod . concurrently with it the ruthenian federation of kievan rus ' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the rurik dynasty grew . the local orthodox christianity of kievan rus ' , while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in constantinople was on the brink of extinction . some of the main regional centres that developed later were novgorod , chernigov , galich , kiev , ryazan , vladimir-upon-klyazma , vladimir of volyn and polotsk .
buddhism began to spread throughout japan during the heian period , primarily through two major esoteric sects , tendai and shingon . tendai originated in china and is based on the lotus sutra , one of the most important sutras of mahayana buddhism ; saichō was key to its transmission to japan . shingon is the japanese transmission of the chinese chen yen school . shingon , brought to japan by the monk kūkai , emphasizes esoteric buddhism . both kūkai and saichō aimed to connect state and religion and establish support from the aristocracy , leading to the notion of 'aristocratic buddhism ' . an important element of tendai doctrine was the suggestion that enlightenment was accessible to " every creature " . saichō also sought independent ordination for tendai monks . a close relationship developed between the tendai monastery complex on mount hiei and the imperial court in its new capital at the foot of the mountain . as a result , tendai emphasized great reverence for the emperor and the nation . kammu himself was a notable patron of the otherworldly tendai sect , which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries . kūkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded emperor kammu , and also generations of japanese , not only with his holiness but also with his poetry , calligraphy , painting , and sculpture . shingon , through its use of " rich symbols , rituals and mandalas " held a wide-ranging appeal .
on 10 february 2010 , the 122nd ioc session at vancouver announced nanjing as the host city for the 2nd summer youth olympic games . the slogan of the 2014 youth olympic games was “ share the games , share our dreams ” . the nanjing 2014 youth olympic games featured all 28 sports on the olympic programme and were held from 16 to 28 august . the nanjing youth olympic games organising committee ( nyogoc ) worked together with the international olympic committee ( ioc ) to attract the best young athletes from around the world to compete at the highest level . off the competition fields , an integrated culture and education programme focused on discussions about education , olympic values , social challenges , and cultural diversity . the yog aims to spread the olympic spirit and encourage sports participation .
a 2009 cochrane review concluded that thiazide antihypertensive drugs reduce the risk of death ( rr 0.89 ) , stroke ( rr 0.63 ) , coronary heart disease ( rr 0.84 ) , and cardiovascular events ( rr 0.70 ) in people with high blood pressure . in the ensuring years other classes of antihypertensive drug were developed and found wide acceptance in combination therapy , including loop diuretics ( lasix/furosemide , hoechst pharmaceuticals , 1963 ) , beta blockers ( ici pharmaceuticals , 1964 ) ace inhibitors , and angiotensin receptor blockers . ace inhibitors reduce the risk of new onset kidney disease [ rr 0.71 ] and death [ rr 0.84 ] in diabetic patients , irrespective of whether they have hypertension .
roman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles , but the most characteristic form of the middle ages was the romance , an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal . controversial , religious , political and instructional literature proliferated during the renaissance as a result of the invention of printing , while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character-based and psychological form of narrative , the novel , of which early and important examples are the chinese monkey and the german faust books .
victoria married her first cousin , prince albert of saxe-coburg and gotha , in 1840 . their nine children married into royal and noble families across the continent , tying them together and earning her the sobriquet " the grandmother of europe " . after albert 's death in 1861 , victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances . as a result of her seclusion , republicanism temporarily gained strength , but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered . her golden and diamond jubilees were times of public celebration .
to pay for his military campaigns and colonial expansion , emperor wu nationalized several private industries . he created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants . these monopolies included salt , iron , and liquor production , as well as bronze-coin currency . the liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 bc , and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early eastern han . the issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the han dynasty . the government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the reformists gained greater influence in the court . the reformists opposed the modernist faction that had dominated court politics in emperor wu 's reign and during the subsequent regency of huo guang ( d. 68 bc ) . the modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy . the reformists , however , overturned these policies , favoring a cautious , non-expansionary approach to foreign policy , frugal budget reform , and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs .
the city is also well provided for in amateur men 's and women 's rugby with a number of teams in and around the city , the oldest of which is trojans rfc who were promoted to london south west 2 division in 2008/9 . a notable former player is anthony allen , who played with leicester tigers as a centre . tottonians are also in london south west division 2 and southampton rfc are in hampshire division 1 in 2009/10 , alongside millbrook rfc and eastleigh rfc . many of the sides run mini and midi teams from under sevens up to under sixteens for both boys and girls .
the origins of the samoans are closely studied in modern research about polynesia in various scientific disciplines such as genetics , linguistics and anthropology . scientific research is ongoing , although a number of different theories exist ; including one proposing that the samoans originated from austronesian predecessors during the terminal eastward lapita expansion period from southeast asia and melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 bce . the samoan origins are currently being reassessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards .
many people gain a sense of positive self-esteem from their identity groups , which furthers a sense of community and belonging . another issue that researchers have attempted to address is the question of why people engage in discrimination , i.e. , why they tend to favor those they consider a part of their " in-group " over those considered to be outsiders . both questions have been given extensive attention by researchers working in the social identity tradition . for example , in work relating to social identity theory it has been shown that merely crafting cognitive distinction between in- and out-groups can lead to subtle effects on people 's evaluations of others ( cote & levine 2002 ) .
idris ' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s ; it had exacerbated libya 's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country 's federal system in order to take advantage of the country 's oil wealth , while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry . arab nationalism was increasingly popular , and protests flared up following egypt 's 1967 defeat in the six-day war with israel ; allied to the western powers , idris ' administration was seen as pro-israeli . anti-western riots broke out in tripoli and benghazi , while libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with egypt . by 1969 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was expecting segments of libya 's armed forces to launch a coup . although claims have been made that they knew of gaddafi 's free officers movement , they have since claimed ignorance , stating that they were monitoring abdul aziz shalhi 's black boots revolutionary group .
these christmas music marathons typically start during the week before thanksgiving day and end after christmas day , or sometimes extending to new year 's day . afterwards , the stations usually resume their normal music fare . several stations begin the holiday format much earlier , at the beginning of november . the roots of this tradition can be traced back to the beautiful music and easy listening stations of the 1960s and 1970s .
deep house 's origins can be traced to chicago producer mr fingers 's relatively jazzy , soulful recordings " mystery of love " ( 1985 ) and " can you feel it ? " ( 1986 ) . according to author richie unterberger , it moved house music away from its " posthuman tendencies back towards the lush " soulful sound of early disco music .
annelids with blood vessels use metanephridia to remove soluble waste products , while those without use protonephridia . both of these systems use a two-stage filtration process , in which fluid and waste products are first extracted and these are filtered again to re-absorb any re-usable materials while dumping toxic and spent materials as urine . the difference is that protonephridia combine both filtration stages in the same organ , while metanephridia perform only the second filtration and rely on other mechanisms for the first – in annelids special filter cells in the walls of the blood vessels let fluids and other small molecules pass into the coelomic fluid , where it circulates to the metanephridia . in annelids the points at which fluid enters the protonephridia or metanephridia are on the forward side of a septum while the second-stage filter and the nephridiopore ( exit opening in the body wall ) are in the following segment . as a result , the hindmost segment ( before the growth zone and pygidium ) has no structure that extracts its wastes , as there is no following segment to filter and discharge them , while the first segment contains an extraction structure that passes wastes to the second , but does not contain the structures that re-filter and discharge urine .
davies identifies paine 's the age of reason as " the link between the two major narratives of what jean-françois lyotard calls the narrative of legitimation " : the rationalism of the 18th-century philosophes and the radical , historically based german 19th-century biblical criticism of the hegelians david friedrich strauss and ludwig feuerbach . " the first is political , largely french in inspiration , and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty ' . the second is philosophical , german , seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge , and stresses understanding rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation . the two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond , and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms . homo homini deus est ( " the human being is a god to humanity " or " god is nothing [ other than ] the human being to himself " ) , feuerbach had written .
a number of pubs claim to be the oldest surviving establishment in the united kingdom , although in several cases original buildings have been demolished and replaced on the same site . others are ancient buildings that saw uses other than as a pub during their history . ye olde fighting cocks in st albans , hertfordshire , holds the guinness world record for the oldest pub in england , as it is an 11th-century structure on an 8th-century site . ye olde trip to jerusalem in nottingham is claimed to be the " oldest inn in england " . it has a claimed date of 1189 , based on the fact it is constructed on the site of the nottingham castle brewhouse ; the present building dates from around 1650 . likewise , the nags head in burntwood , staffordshire only dates back to the 16th century , but there has been a pub on the site since at least 1086 , as it is mentioned in the domesday book .
orthodox judaism holds that on mount sinai , the written law was transmitted along with an oral law . the words of the torah ( pentateuch ) were spoken to moses by god ; the laws contained in this written torah , the " mitzvot " , were given along with detailed explanations in the oral tradition as to how to apply and interpret them . furthermore , the oral law includes principles designed to create new rules . the oral law is held to be transmitted with an extremely high degree of accuracy . jewish theologians , who choose to emphasize the more evolutionary nature of the halacha point to a famous story in the talmud , where moses is miraculously transported to the house of study of rabbi akiva and is clearly unable to follow the ensuing discussion .
over 90 weeklies , fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in sanskrit . sudharma , a daily newspaper in sanskrit , has been published out of mysore , india , since 1970 , while sanskrit vartman patram and vishwasya vrittantam started in gujarat during the last five years . since 1974 , there has been a short daily news broadcast on state-run all india radio . these broadcasts are also made available on the internet on air 's website . sanskrit news is broadcast on tv and on the internet through the dd national channel at 6:55 am ist .
according to author michael carrithers , while there are good reasons to doubt the traditional account , " the outline of the life must be true : birth , maturity , renunciation , search , awakening and liberation , teaching , death . " in writing her biography of the buddha , karen armstrong noted , " it is obviously difficult , therefore , to write a biography of the buddha that meets modern criteria , because we have very little information that can be considered historically sound ... [ but ] we can be reasonably confident siddhatta gotama did indeed exist and that his disciples preserved the memory of his life and teachings as well as they could . " [ dubious – discuss ]
during april , fourteenth army advanced 300 miles ( 480 km ) south towards rangoon , the capital and principal port of burma , but was delayed by japanese rearguards 40 miles ( 64 km ) north of rangoon at the end of the month . slim feared that the japanese would defend rangoon house-to-house during the monsoon , placing his army in a disastrous supply situation , and in march he had asked that a plan to capture rangoon by an amphibious force , operation dracula , which had been abandoned earlier , be reinstated . dracula was launched on 1 may , but rangoon was found to have been abandoned . the troops which occupied rangoon linked up with fourteenth army five days later , securing the allies ' lines of communication .
economists argue that one of the factors behind the differing economic development in africa and asia is that in africa , corruption has primarily taken the form of rent extraction with the resulting financial capital moved overseas rather than invested at home ( hence the stereotypical , but often accurate , image of african dictators having swiss bank accounts ) . in nigeria , for example , more than $ 400 billion was stolen from the treasury by nigeria 's leaders between 1960 and 1999 .
although it had equipment capable of doing serious damage , the problem for the luftwaffe was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence . okl had not been informed that britain was to be considered a potential opponent until early 1938 . it had no time to gather reliable intelligence on britain 's industries . moreover , okl could not settle on an appropriate strategy . german planners had to decide whether the luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of british industry such as aircraft factories , or against a system of interrelated industries such as britain 's import and distribution network , or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the british population . the luftwaffe 's strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of 1940–1941 . disputes among the okl staff revolved more around tactics than strategy . this method condemned the offensive over britain to failure before it began .
domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes . modern dog breeds show more variation in size , appearance , and behavior than any other domestic animal . dogs are predators and scavengers , and like many other predatory mammals , the dog has powerful muscles , fused wrist bones , a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance , and teeth for catching and tearing .
ertuğrul , the father of osman i ( founder of the ottoman empire ) , arrived in anatolia from merv ( turkmenistan ) with 400 horsemen to aid the seljuks of rum against the byzantines . after the demise of the turkish seljuk sultanate of rum in the 14th century , anatolia was divided into a patchwork of independent , mostly turkish states , the so-called ghazi emirates . one of the emirates was led by osman i ( 1258–1326 ) , from whom the name ottoman is derived . osman i extended the frontiers of turkish settlement toward the edge of the byzantine empire . it is not well understood how the early ottomans came to dominate their neighbours , as the history of medieval anatolia is still little known .
on 26 february 2012 , the sun on sunday was launched to replace the closed news of the world , employing some of its former journalists . in late 2013 , it was given a new look , with a new typeface . the average circulation for the sun on sunday in march 2014 was 1,686,840 ; but in may 2015 the mail on sunday sold more copies for the first time , an average of 28,650 over those of its rival : 1,497,855 to 1,469,195 . roy greenslade issued some caveats over the may 2015 figures , but believes the weekday daily mail will overtake the sun in circulation during 2016 .
whereas greg had limited his illustrative examples to english renaissance drama , where his expertise lay , bowers argued that the rationale was " the most workable editorial principle yet contrived to produce a critical text that is authoritative in the maximum of its details whether the author be shakespeare , dryden , fielding , nathaniel hawthorne , or stephen crane . the principle is sound without regard for the literary period . " for works where an author 's manuscript survived – a case greg had not considered – bowers concluded that the manuscript should generally serve as copy-text . citing the example of nathaniel hawthorne , he noted :
prizes are awarded on the results of trials ( internal exams ) , gcse and as-levels . in addition , many subjects and activities have specially endowed prizes , several of which are awarded by visiting experts . the most prestigious is the newcastle scholarship , awarded on the strength of an examination , consisting of two papers in philosophical theology , moral theory and applied ethics . also of note are the gladstone memorial prize and the coutts prize , awarded on the results of trials and as-level examinations in c ; and the huxley prize , awarded for a project on a scientific subject . other specialist prizes include the newcastle classical prize ; the rosebery exhibition for history ; the queen ’ s prizes for french and german ; the duke of newcastle ’ s russian prize ; the beddington spanish prize ; the strafford and bowman shakespeare prizes ; the tomline and russell prizes in mathematics ; the sotheby prize for history of art ; the waddington prize for theology and philosophy ; the birley prize for history ; the lower boy rosebery prize and the wilder prize for theology . prizes are awarded too for excellence in such activities as painting , sculpture , ceramics , playing musical instruments , musical composition , declamation , silverwork , and design .

early civilisations in myanmar included the tibeto-burman-speaking pyu city-states in upper burma and the mon kingdoms in lower burma . in the 9th century , the bamar people entered the upper irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the pagan kingdom in the 1050s , the burmese language , culture and theravada buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . the pagan kingdom fell due to the mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . in the 16th century , reunified by the taungoo dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of southeast asia . the early 19th century konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern myanmar and briefly controlled manipur and assam as well . the british conquered myanmar after three anglo-burmese wars in the 19th century and the country became a british colony . myanmar became an independent nation in 1948 , initially as a democratic nation and then , following a coup d'état in 1962 , a military dictatorship .
the " photoelectrons " emitted as a result of the photoelectric effect have a certain kinetic energy , which can be measured . this kinetic energy ( for each photoelectron ) is independent of the intensity of the light , but depends linearly on the frequency ; and if the frequency is too low ( corresponding to a photon energy that is less than the work function of the material ) , no photoelectrons are emitted at all , unless a plurality of photons , whose energetic sum is greater than the energy of the photoelectrons , acts virtually simultaneously ( multiphoton effect ) assuming the frequency is high enough to cause the photoelectric effect , a rise in intensity of the light source causes more photoelectrons to be emitted with the same kinetic energy , rather than the same number of photoelectrons to be emitted with higher kinetic energy .
geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the scientific revolution , but individual theorists made important contributions . robert hooke , for example , formulated a theory of earthquakes , and nicholas steno developed the theory of superposition and argued that fossils were the remains of once-living creatures . beginning with thomas burnet 's sacred theory of the earth in 1681 , natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the earth had changed over time . burnet and his contemporaries interpreted earth 's past in terms of events described in the bible , but their work laid the intellectual foundations for secular interpretations of earth history .
from the fifth-generation ipod on , apple introduced a user-configurable volume limit in response to concerns about hearing loss . users report that in the sixth-generation ipod , the maximum volume output level is limited to 100 db in eu markets . apple previously had to remove ipods from shelves in france for exceeding this legal limit . however , users that have bought a new sixth-generation ipod in late 2013 have reported a new option that allowed them to disable the eu volume limit . it has been said that these new ipods came with an updated software that allowed this change . older sixth-generation ipods , however , are unable to update to this software version .
new york is also a major center for non-commercial educational media . the oldest public-access television channel in the united states is the manhattan neighborhood network , founded in 1971 . wnet is the city 's major public television station and a primary source of national public broadcasting service ( pbs ) television programming . wnyc , a public radio station owned by the city until 1997 , has the largest public radio audience in the united states .
everton f.c . is a limited company with the board of directors holding a majority of the shares . the club 's most recent accounts , from may 2014 , show a net total debt of £28.1 million , with a turnover of £120.5 million and a profit of £28.2 million . the club 's overdraft with barclays bank is secured against the premier league 's " basic award fund " , a guaranteed sum given to clubs for competing in the premier league . everton agreed a long-term loan of £30 million with bear stearns and prudential plc in 2002 over the duration of 25 years ; a consolidation of debts at the time as well as a source of capital for new player acquisitions . goodison park is secured as collateral .
a watt balance is an instrument for comparing two powers , one of which is measured in si watts and the other of which is measured in conventional electrical units . from the definition of the conventional watt w90 , this gives a measure of the product kj2rk in si units , where rk is the von klitzing constant which appears in the quantum hall effect . if the theoretical treatments of the josephson effect and the quantum hall effect are valid , and in particular assuming that rk = h/e2 , the measurement of kj2rk is a direct determination of the planck constant .
brasília is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports , sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings . practitioners of such sports reveal that , because of the city 's dry weather , the city offers strong thermal winds and great " cloud-streets " , which is also the name for a manoeuvre quite appreciated by practitioners . in 2003 , brasília hosted the 14th hang gliding world championship , one of the categories of free flying . in august 2005 , the city hosted the 2nd stage of the brazilian hang gliding championship .
parasitoids are organisms living in or on their host and feeding directly upon it , eventually leading to its death . they are much like parasites in their close symbiotic relationship with their host or hosts . like the previous two classifications parasitoid predators do not kill their hosts instantly . however , unlike parasites , they are very similar to true predators in that the fate of their prey is quite inevitably death . a well-known example of a parasitoids are the ichneumon wasps , solitary insects living a free life as an adult , then laying eggs on or in another species such as a caterpillar . its larva ( e ) feed on the growing host causing it little harm at first , but soon devouring the internal organs until finally destroying the nervous system resulting in prey death . by this stage the young wasp ( s ) are developed sufficiently to move to the next stage in their life cycle . though limited mainly to the insect order hymenoptera , diptera and coleoptera parasitoids make up as much as 10 % of all insect species .
westminster abbey , formally titled the collegiate church of st peter at westminster , is a large , mainly gothic abbey church in the city of westminster , london , located just to the west of the palace of westminster . it is one of the most notable religious buildings in the united kingdom and has been the traditional place of coronation and burial site for english and , later , british monarchs . between 1540 and 1556 the abbey had the status of a cathedral . since 1560 , however , the building is no longer an abbey nor a cathedral , having instead the status of a church of england " royal peculiar " —a church responsible directly to the sovereign . the building itself is the original abbey church .
the 19th century also saw the use of red in art to create specific emotions , not just to imitate nature . it saw the systematic study of color theory , and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other . these studies were avidly followed by artists such as vincent van gogh . describing his painting , the night cafe , to his brother theo in 1888 , van gogh wrote : " i sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions . the hall is blood red and pale yellow , with a green billiard table in the center , and four lamps of lemon yellow , with rays of orange and green . everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens . "
the czechs ' language separated from other slavic tongues into what would later be called old czech by the thirteenth century , a classification extending through the sixteenth century . its use of cases differed from the modern language ; although old czech did not yet have a vocative case or an animacy distinction , declension for its six cases and three genders rapidly became complicated ( partially to differentiate homophones ) and its declension patterns resembled those of lithuanian ( its balto-slavic cousin ) .
today the boundaries of the ukrainian language to the russian language are still not drawn clearly , with an intermediate dialect between them , called surzhyk , developing in ukraine .
several studies have suggested that dst increases motor fuel consumption . the 2008 doe report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the 2007 united states extension of dst .
the period known as classical antiquity began with the rise of the city-states of ancient greece . greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of alexander the great , spreading throughout asia .
the process of morphological derivation in catalan follows the same principles as the other romance languages , where agglutination is common . many times , several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme , and some sound alternations can occur , for example elèctric [ əˈlɛktrik ] ( " electrical " ) vs. electricitat [ ələktrisiˈtat ] . prefixes are usually appended to verbs , for as in preveure ( " foresee " ) .
during the war , plans were drawn up to quell welsh nationalism by affiliating elizabeth more closely with wales . proposals , such as appointing her constable of caernarfon castle or a patron of urdd gobaith cymru ( the welsh league of youth ) , were abandoned for various reasons , which included a fear of associating elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the urdd , at a time when britain was at war . welsh politicians suggested that she be made princess of wales on her 18th birthday . home secretary , herbert morrison supported the idea , but the king rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a prince of wales and the prince of wales had always been the heir apparent . in 1946 , she was inducted into the welsh gorsedd of bards at the national eisteddfod of wales .
there are several types of multi-color white leds : di- , tri- , and tetrachromatic white leds . several key factors that play among these different methods , include color stability , color rendering capability , and luminous efficacy . often , higher efficiency will mean lower color rendering , presenting a trade-off between the luminous efficacy and color rendering . for example , the dichromatic white leds have the best luminous efficacy ( 120 lm/w ) , but the lowest color rendering capability . however , although tetrachromatic white leds have excellent color rendering capability , they often have poor luminous efficacy . trichromatic white leds are in between , having both good luminous efficacy ( > 70 lm/w ) and fair color rendering capability .
the weston cadet ( model 852 introduced in 1949 ) , direct reading ( model 853 introduced 1954 ) and master iii ( models 737 and s141.3 introduced in 1956 ) were the first in their line of exposure meters to switch and utilize the meanwhile established asa scale instead . other models used the original weston scale up until ca . 1955 . the company continued to publish weston film ratings after 1955 , but while their recommended values often differed slightly from the asa film speeds found on film boxes , these newer weston values were based on the asa system and had to be converted for use with older weston meters by subtracting 1/3 exposure stop as per weston 's recommendation . vice versa , " old " weston film speed ratings could be converted into " new " westons and the asa scale by adding the same amount , that is , a film rating of 100 weston ( up to 1955 ) corresponded with 125 asa ( as per asa ph2.5-1954 and before ) . this conversion was not necessary on weston meters manufactured and weston film ratings published since 1956 due to their inherent use of the asa system ; however the changes of the asa ph2.5-1960 revision may be taken into account when comparing with newer asa or iso values .
the earliest known document in galician-portuguese dates from 1228 . the foro do bo burgo do castro caldelas was granted by alfonso ix of león to the town of burgo , in castro caldelas , after the model of the constitutions of the town of allariz . a distinct galician literature emerged during the middle ages : in the 13th century important contributions were made to the romance canon in galician-portuguese , the most notable those by the troubadour martín codax , the priest airas nunes , king denis of portugal and king alfonso x of castile , alfonso o sabio ( " alfonso the wise " ) , the same monarch who began the process of establishing the hegemony of castilian . during this period , galician-portuguese was considered the language of love poetry in the iberian romance linguistic culture . the names and memories of codax and other popular cultural figures are well preserved in modern galicia and , despite the long period of castilian linguistic domination , these names are again household words .
research into lcps ( low cost private schools ) found that over 5 years to july 2013 , debate around lcpss to achieving education for all ( efa ) objectives was polarised and finding growing coverage in international policy . the polarisation was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor , reach disadvantaged groups , provide quality education , support or undermine equality , and are financially sustainable . the report examined the main challenges encountered by development organisations which support lcpss . surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across africa and asia . this success is attributed to excess demand . these surveys found concern for :

the ottoman empire ( /ˈɒtəmən/ ; ottoman turkish : دَوْلَتِ عَلِيّهٔ عُثمَانِیّه‎ devlet-i aliyye-i osmâniyye , modern turkish : osmanlı imparatorluğu or osmanlı devleti ) , also known as the turkish empire , ottoman turkey or turkey , was an empire founded in 1299 by oghuz turks under osman i in northwestern anatolia . after conquests in the balkans by murad i between 1362 and 1389 , the ottoman sultanate was transformed into a transcontinental empire and claimant to the caliphate . the ottomans ended the byzantine empire with the 1453 conquest of constantinople by mehmed the conqueror .
nigeria is home to a substantial network of organised crime , active especially in drug trafficking . nigerian criminal groups are heavily involved in drug trafficking , shipping heroin from asian countries to europe and america ; and cocaine from south america to europe and south africa . . the various nigerian confraternities or " campus cults " are active in both organised crime and in political violence as well as providing a network of corruption within nigeria . as confraternities have extensive connections with political and military figures , they offer excellent alumni networking opportunities . the supreme vikings confraternity , for example , boasts that twelve members of the rivers state house of assembly are cult members . on lower levels of society , there are the " area boys " , organised gangs mostly active in lagos who specialise in mugging and small-scale drug dealing . according to official statistics , gang violence in lagos resulted in 273 civilians and 84 policemen killed in the period of august 2000 to may 2001 .
film speed is used in the exposure equations to find the appropriate exposure parameters . four variables are available to the photographer to obtain the desired effect : lighting , film speed , f-number ( aperture size ) , and shutter speed ( exposure time ) . the equation may be expressed as ratios , or , by taking the logarithm ( base 2 ) of both sides , by addition , using the apex system , in which every increment of 1 is a doubling of exposure ; this increment is commonly known as a " stop " . the effective f-number is proportional to the ratio between the lens focal length and aperture diameter , the diameter itself being proportional to the square root of the aperture area . thus , a lens set to f/1.4 allows twice as much light to strike the focal plane as a lens set to f/2 . therefore , each f-number factor of the square root of two ( approximately 1.4 ) is also a stop , so lenses are typically marked in that progression : f/1.4 , 2 , 2.8 , 4 , 5.6 , 8 , 11 , 16 , 22 , 32 , etc .
in dutch , the diminutive is not merely restricted to nouns and exist in numerals ( met z'n tweetjes , " the two of us " ) , pronouns ( onderonsje , " tête-à-tête " ) , verbal particles ( moetje , " shotgun marriage " ) , and even prepositions ( toetje , " dessert " ) . most notable however , are the diminutive forms of adjectives and adverbs . the former take an diminutive ending and thus functions as a noun , the latter remain adverbs and have always the diminutive with the -s appended , e.g . adjective : groen ( " green " ) → noun : groentje ( " rookie " ) ; adverb : even ( " just " ) → adverb : eventjes ( " just a minute " ) .
during most of the neolithic age of eurasia , people lived in small tribes composed of multiple bands or lineages . there is little scientific evidence of developed social stratification in most neolithic societies ; social stratification is more associated with the later bronze age . although some late eurasian neolithic societies formed complex stratified chiefdoms or even states , states evolved in eurasia only with the rise of metallurgy , and most neolithic societies on the whole were relatively simple and egalitarian . beyond eurasia , however , states were formed during the local neolithic in three areas , namely in the preceramic andes with the norte chico civilization , formative mesoamerica and ancient hawaiʻi . however , most neolithic societies were noticeably more hierarchical than the paleolithic cultures that preceded them and hunter-gatherer cultures in general .
the manchurian strategic offensive operation began on 9 august 1945 , with the soviet invasion of the japanese puppet state of manchukuo and was the last campaign of the second world war and the largest of the 1945 soviet–japanese war which resumed hostilities between the soviet union and the empire of japan after almost six years of peace . soviet gains on the continent were manchukuo , mengjiang ( inner mongolia ) and northern korea . the rapid defeat of japan 's kwantung army has been argued to be a significant factor in the japanese surrender and the end of world war ii , as japan realized the soviets were willing and able to take the cost of invasion of its home islands , after their rapid conquest of manchuria and invasion of south sakhalin island .
plato 's theory of forms or " ideas " describes ideal forms ( for example the platonic solids in geometry or abstracts like goodness and justice ) , as universals existing independently of any particular instance . arne grøn calls this doctrine " the classic example of a metaphysical idealism as a transcendent idealism " , while simone klein calls plato " the earliest representative of metaphysical objective idealism " . nevertheless , plato holds that matter is real , though transitory and imperfect , and is perceived by our body and its senses and given existence by the eternal ideas that are perceived directly by our rational soul . plato was therefore a metaphysical and epistemological dualist , an outlook that modern idealism has striven to avoid : plato 's thought can not therefore be counted as idealist in the modern sense , although quantum physics ' assertion that man 's consciousness is an immutable and primary requisite for not merely perceiving but shaping matter , and thus his reality , would give more credence to plato 's dualist position .

unlike vermilion or red ochre , made from minerals , red lake pigments are made by mixing organic dyes , made from insects or plants , with white chalk or alum . red lac was made from the gum lac , the dark red resinous substance secreted by various scale insects , particularly the laccifer lacca from india . carmine lake was made from the cochineal insect from central and south america , kermes lake came from a different scale insect , kermes vermilio , which thrived on oak trees around the mediterranean . other red lakes were made from the rose madder plant and from the brazilwood tree .
alban butler , writes on the subject : " five months after this great council , nicae , st alexander lying on his death-bed , recommended to his clergy and people the choice of athanasius for his successor , thrice repeating his name . in consequence of his recommendation , the bishops of all egypt assembled at alexandria , and finding the people and clergy unanimous in their choice of athanasius for patriarch , they confirmed the election about the middle of year 326 . he seems , then , to have been about thirty years of age. "
white-box testing ( also known as clear box testing , glass box testing , transparent box testing and structural testing , by seeing the source code ) tests internal structures or workings of a program , as opposed to the functionality exposed to the end-user . in white-box testing an internal perspective of the system , as well as programming skills , are used to design test cases . the tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the appropriate outputs . this is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit , e.g . in-circuit testing ( ict ) .
the arthur ravenel jr. bridge across the cooper river opened on july 16 , 2005 , and was the second-longest cable-stayed bridge in the americas at the time of its construction . [ citation needed ] the bridge links mount pleasant with downtown charleston , and has eight lanes plus a 12-foot lane shared by pedestrians and bicycles . it replaced the grace memorial bridge ( built in 1929 ) and the silas n. pearman bridge ( built in 1966 ) . they were considered two of the more dangerous bridges in america and were demolished after the ravenel bridge opened .
the chapter house was built concurrently with the east parts of the abbey under henry iii , between about 1245 and 1253 . it was restored by sir george gilbert scott in 1872 . the entrance is approached from the east cloister walk and includes a double doorway with a large tympanum above .
new haven 's best-known geographic features are its large deep harbor , and two reddish basalt trap rock ridges which rise to the northeast and northwest of the city core . these trap rocks are known respectively as east rock and west rock , and both serve as extensive parks . west rock has been tunneled through to make way for the east-west passage of the wilbur cross parkway ( the only highway tunnel through a natural obstacle in connecticut ) , and once served as the hideout of the " regicides " ( see : regicides trail ) . most new haveners refer to these men as " the three judges " . east rock features the prominent soldiers and sailors war monument on its peak as well as the " great/giant steps " which run up the rock 's cliffside .
large numbers of bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language , culture , customs , and communal organization throughout the spanish conquest and the post-independence period . they mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of " empowered caciques " to further communal organization . indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953 . while the national revolutionary movement government begun in 1952 discouraged self-identification as indigenous ( reclassifying rural people as campesinos , or peasants ) , renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the katarista movement beginning in the 1970s . lowland indigenous peoples , mostly in the east , entered national politics through the 1990 march for territory and dignity organized by the cidob confederation . that march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ilo convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and titling indigenous territories . the 1994 law of popular participation granted " grassroots territorial organizations " that are recognized by the state certain rights to govern local areas .
the stated objective of most intellectual property law ( with the exception of trademarks ) is to " promote progress . " by exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works , society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit , and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work . some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be " absolute protection " . " if some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation , they reason , more is better . the thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions " . this absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of " real " property , typically adopting its law and rhetoric . other recent developments in intellectual property law , such as the america invents act , stress international harmonization . recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage , including intangible ones , as well as over risks of commodification derived from this possibility . the issue still remains open in legal scholarship .
though most computers since mid-2004 can boot from usb mass storage devices , usb is not intended as a primary bus for a computer 's internal storage . buses such as parallel ata ( pata or ide ) , serial ata ( sata ) , or scsi fulfill that role in pc class computers . however , usb has one important advantage , in that it is possible to install and remove devices without rebooting the computer ( hot-swapping ) , making it useful for mobile peripherals , including drives of various kinds ( given sata or scsi devices may or may not support hot-swapping ) .
in the 5th-century ravenna , the capital of the western roman empire , became the center of late roman mosaic art . the mausoleum of galla placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430 . the vaults of the small , cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background . the central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky . another great building established by galla placidia was the church of san giovanni evangelista . she erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from constantinople to ravenna . the mosaics depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of ravenna , peter chrysologus . they are known only from renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
with the neoplatonist plotinus , wrote nathaniel alfred boll ; " there even appears , probably for the first time in western philosophy , idealism that had long been current in the east even at that time , for it taught ... that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time ... " . similarly , in regard to passages from the enneads , " the only space or place of the world is the soul " and " time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul " , ludwig noiré wrote : " for the first time in western philosophy we find idealism proper in plotinus , however , plotinus does not address whether we know external objects , unlike schopenhauer and other modern philosophers .
paper waste accounts for up to 40 % of total waste produced in the united states each year , which adds up to 71.6 million tons of paper waste per year in the united states alone . the average office worker in the us prints 31 pages every day . americans also use on the order of 16 billion paper cups per year .
in the following decades there was a constant battle between the company lobby and the parliament . the company sought a permanent establishment , while the parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company 's profits . in 1712 , another act renewed the status of the company , though the debts were repaid . by 1720 , 15 % of british imports were from india , almost all passing through the company , which reasserted the influence of the company lobby . the licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730 .
rajasthan 's economy is primarily agricultural and pastoral . wheat and barley are cultivated over large areas , as are pulses , sugarcane , and oilseeds . cotton and tobacco are the state 's cash crops . rajasthan is among the largest producers of edible oils in india and the second largest producer of oilseeds . rajasthan is also the biggest wool-producing state in india and the main opium producer and consumer . there are mainly two crop seasons . the water for irrigation comes from wells and tanks . the indira gandhi canal irrigates northwestern rajasthan .
the community of casas adobes is also on the northwest side , with the distinction of being tucson 's first suburb , established in the late 1940s . casas adobes is centered on the historic casas adobes plaza ( built in 1948 ) . casas adobes is also home to tohono chul park ( a nature preserve ) near the intersection of north oracle road and west ina road . the attempted assassination of representative gabrielle giffords , and the murders of chief judge for the u.s. district court for arizona , john roll and five other people on january 8 , 2011 , occurred at the la toscana village in casas adobes . the foothills mall is also located on the northwest side in casas adobes .
the earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the hallstatt and la tène cultures , named after the archaeological site of la tène on the north side of lake neuchâtel . la tène culture developed and flourished during the late iron age from around 450 bc , possibly under some influence from the greek and etruscan civilisations . one of the most important tribal groups in the swiss region was the helvetii . steadily harassed by the germans , in 58 bc the helvetii decided to abandon the swiss plateau and migrate to western gallia , but julius caesar 's armies pursued and defeated them at the battle of bibracte , in today 's western france , forcing the tribe to move back to its original homeland . in 15 bc , tiberius , who was destined to be the second roman emperor and his brother , drusus , conquered the alps , integrating them into the roman empire . the area occupied by the helvetii—the namesakes of the later confoederatio helvetica—first became part of rome 's gallia belgica province and then of its germania superior province , while the eastern portion of modern switzerland was integrated into the roman province of raetia . sometime around the start of the common era , the romans maintained a large legionary camp called vindonissa , now a ruin at the confluence of the aare and reuss rivers , near the town of windisch , an outskirt of brugg .
greece 's technology parks with incubator facilities include the science and technology park of crete ( heraklion ) , the thessaloniki technology park , the lavrio technology park and the patras science park , the science and technology park of epirus ( ioannina ) . greece has been a member of the european space agency ( esa ) since 2005 . cooperation between esa and the hellenic national space committee began in the early 1990s . in 1994 greece and esa signed their first cooperation agreement . having formally applied for full membership in 2003 , greece became the esa 's sixteenth member on 16 march 2005 . as member of the esa , greece participates in the agency 's telecommunication and technology activities , and the global monitoring for environment and security initiative .
south america became linked to north america through the isthmus of panama during the pliocene , bringing a nearly complete end to south america 's distinctive marsupial faunas . the formation of the isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures , since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an atlantic cooling cycle began , with cold arctic and antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated atlantic ocean . africa 's collision with europe formed the mediterranean sea , cutting off the remnants of the tethys ocean . sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between alaska and asia . near the end of the pliocene , about 2.58 million years ago ( the start of the quaternary period ) , the current ice age began . the polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw , repeating every 40,000–100,000 years .
apple spent $ 2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special , post-election issue of newsweek , and ran a " test drive a macintosh " promotion , in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards . while 200,000 people participated , dealers disliked the promotion , the supply of computers was insufficient for demand , and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold . this marketing campaign caused ceo john sculley to raise the price from us $ 1,995 to us $ 2,495 ( about $ 5,200 when adjusted for inflation in 2010 ) . the computer sold well , nonetheless , reportedly outselling the ibm pcjr which also began shipping early that year . by april 1984 the company sold 50,000 macintoshes , and hoped for 70,000 by early may and almost 250,000 by the end of the year .
dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television , the internet , magazines , catalogs and newspapers . some of dell inc 's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year , free bonus products ( such as dell printers ) , and free shipping to encourage more sales and stave off competitors . in 2006 , dell cut its prices in an effort to maintain its 19.2 % market share . this also cut profit-margins by more than half , from 8.7 to 4.3 percent . to maintain its low prices , dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the internet and through the telephone network , and to move its customer-care division to india and el salvador .
general dong zhuo ( d. 192 ad ) found the young emperor and his brother wandering in the countryside . he escorted them safely back to the capital and was made minister of works , taking control of luoyang and forcing yuan shao to flee . after dong zhuo demoted emperor shao and promoted his brother liu xie as emperor xian , yuan shao led a coalition of former officials and officers against dong , who burned luoyang to the ground and resettled the court at chang'an in may 191 ad . dong zhuo later poisoned emperor shao .
the pits and lands themselves do not directly represent the zeros and ones of binary data . instead , non-return-to-zero , inverted encoding is used : a change from pit to land or land to pit indicates a one , while no change indicates a series of zeros . there must be at least two and no more than ten zeros between each one , which is defined by the length of the pit . this in turn is decoded by reversing the eight-to-fourteen modulation used in mastering the disc , and then reversing the cross-interleaved reed–solomon coding , finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc . these encoding techniques ( defined in the red book ) were originally designed for cd digital audio , but they later became a standard for almost all cd formats ( such as cd-rom ) .
saint barthélemy , a volcanic island fully encircled by shallow reefs , has an area of 25 square kilometres ( 9.7 sq mi ) and a population of 9,035 ( jan. 2011 estimate ) . its capital is gustavia [ citation needed ] , which also contains the main harbour to the island . it is the only caribbean island which was a swedish colony for any significant length of time ; guadeloupe was under swedish rule only briefly at the end of the napoleonic wars . symbolism from the swedish national arms , the three crowns , still appears in the island 's coat of arms . the language , cuisine , and culture , however , are distinctly french . the island is a popular tourist destination during the winter holiday season , especially for the rich and famous during the christmas and new year period .
the café procope was established in paris in 1686 ; by the 1720s there were around 400 cafés in the city . the café procope in particular became a center of enlightenment , welcoming such celebrities as voltaire and rousseau . the café procope was where diderot and d'alembert decided to create the encyclopédie . the cafés were one of the various " nerve centers " for bruits publics , public noise or rumour . these bruits were allegedly a much better source of information than were the actual newspapers available at the time .
the attainment of high efficiency in blue leds was quickly followed by the development of the first white led . in this device a y 3al 5o 12 : ce ( known as " yag " ) phosphor coating on the emitter absorbs some of the blue emission and produces yellow light through fluorescence . the combination of that yellow with remaining blue light appears white to the eye . however using different phosphors ( fluorescent materials ) it also became possible to instead produce green and red light through fluorescence . the resulting mixture of red , green and blue is not only perceived by humans as white light but is superior for illumination in terms of color rendering , whereas one can not appreciate the color of red or green objects illuminated only by the yellow ( and remaining blue ) wavelengths from the yag phosphor .
because it is normal to have bacterial colonization , it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected . despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice , there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs . a review of chronic wounds in the journal of the american medical association 's " rational clinical examination series " quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection . the review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [ likelihood ratio ( lr ) range , 11-20 ] makes infection much more likely , but the absence of pain ( negative likelihood ratio range , 0.64-0.88 ) does not rule out infection ( summary lr 0.64-0.88 ) .
behind the scenes , the bookers in a company will place the title on the most accomplished performer , or those the bookers believe will generate fan interest in terms of event attendance and television viewership . lower ranked titles may also be used on the performers who show potential , thus allowing them greater exposure to the audience . however other circumstances may also determine the use of a championship . a combination of a championship 's lineage , the caliber of performers as champion , and the frequency and manner of title changes , dictates the audience 's perception of the title 's quality , significance and reputation .
opponents of the endangered species act argue that with over 2,000 endangered species listed , and only 28 delisted due to recovery , the success rate of 1 % over nearly three decades proves that there needs to be serious reform in their methods to actually help the endangered animals and plants . others argue that the esa may encourage preemptive habitat destruction by landowners who fear losing the use of their land because of the presence of an endangered species ; known colloquially as " shoot , shovel and shut-up . " one example of such perverse incentives is the case of a forest owner who , in response to esa listing of the red-cockaded woodpecker , increased harvesting and shortened the age at which he harvests his trees to ensure that they do not become old enough to become suitable habitat . while no studies have shown that the act 's negative effects , in total , exceed the positive effects , many economists believe that finding a way to reduce such perverse incentives would lead to more effective protection of endangered species .
active in the early 1920s , f.c.s . schiller labelled his work " humanism " but for schiller the term referred to the pragmatist philosophy he shared with william james . in 1929 , charles francis potter founded the first humanist society of new york whose advisory board included julian huxley , john dewey , albert einstein and thomas mann . potter was a minister from the unitarian tradition and in 1930 he and his wife , clara cook potter , published humanism : a new religion . throughout the 1930s , potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as , women ’ s rights , access to birth control , " civil divorce laws " , and an end to capital punishment .
the islamic golden age coincided with the middle ages in the muslim world , starting with the rise of islam and establishment of the first islamic state in 622 . the end of the age is variously given as 1258 with the mongolian sack of baghdad , or 1492 with the completion of the christian reconquista of the emirate of granada in al-andalus , iberian peninsula . during the reign of the abbasid caliph harun ar-rashid ( 786 to 809 ) , the legendary house of wisdom was inaugurated in baghdad where scholars from various parts of the world sought to translate and gather all the known world 's knowledge into arabic . the abbasids were influenced by the quranic injunctions and hadiths , such as " the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr , " that stressed the value of knowledge . the major islamic capital cities of baghdad , cairo , and córdoba became the main intellectual centers for science , philosophy , medicine , and education . during this period , the muslim world was a collection of cultures ; they drew together and advanced the knowledge gained from the ancient greek , roman , persian , chinese , indian , egyptian , and phoenician civilizations .
the original city council line-up of 14 members ( nine district-based and five at-large positions ) was based on a u.s. justice department mandate which took effect in 1979 . at-large council members represent the entire city . under the city charter , once the population in the city limits exceeded 2.1 million residents , two additional districts were to be added . the city of houston 's official 2010 census count was 600 shy of the required number ; however , as the city was expected to grow beyond 2.1 million shortly thereafter , the two additional districts were added for , and the positions filled during , the august 2011 elections .
after golf , oil painting was eisenhower 's second hobby . while at columbia university , eisenhower began the art after watching thomas e. stephens paint mamie 's portrait . eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life to relax , mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as mamie , their grandchildren , general montgomery , george washington , and abraham lincoln . wendy beckett stated that eisenhower 's work , " simple and earnest , rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president " . a conservative in both art and politics , he in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as " a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down tin lizzie , loaded with paint , has been driven over it . "
melbourne universities have campuses all over australia and some internationally . swinburne university has campuses in malaysia , while monash has a research centre based in prato , italy . the university of melbourne , the second oldest university in australia , was ranked first among australian universities in the 2010 thes international rankings . the 2012–2013 times higher education supplement ranked the university of melbourne as the 28th ( 30th by qs ranking ) best university in the world . monash university was ranked as the 99th ( 60th by qs ranking ) best university in the world . both universities are members of the group of eight , a coalition of leading australian tertiary institutions offering comprehensive and leading education .
the bandwidth characteristics of a resonant antenna element can be characterized according to its q , just as one uses to characterize the sharpness of an l-c resonant circuit . however it is often assumed that there is an advantage in an antenna having a high q . after all , q is short for " quality factor " and a low q typically signifies excessive loss ( due to unwanted resistance ) in a resonant l-c circuit . however this understanding does not apply to resonant antennas where the resistance involved is the radiation resistance , a desired quantity which removes energy from the resonant element in order to radiate it ( the purpose of an antenna , after all ! ) . the q is a measure of the ratio of reactance to resistance , so with a fixed radiation resistance ( an element 's radiation resistance is almost independent of its diameter ) a greater reactance off-resonance corresponds to the poorer bandwidth of a very thin conductor . the q of such a narrowband antenna can be as high as 15 . on the other hand , a thick element presents less reactance at an off-resonant frequency , and consequently a q as low as 5 . these two antennas will perform equivalently at the resonant frequency , but the second antenna will perform over a bandwidth 3 times as wide as the " hi-q " antenna consisting of a thin conductor .
what drove circadian rhythms to evolve has been an enigmatic question . previous hypotheses emphasized that photosensitive proteins and circadian rhythms may have originated together in the earliest cells , with the purpose of protecting replicating dna from high levels of damaging ultraviolet radiation during the daytime . as a result , replication was relegated to the dark . however , evidence for this is lacking , since the simplest organisms with a circadian rhythm , the cyanobacteria , do the opposite of this - they divide more in the daytime . recent studies instead highlight the importance of co-evolution of redox proteins with circadian oscillators in all three kingdoms of life following the great oxidation event approximately 2.3 billion years ago . the current view is that circadian changes in environmental oxygen levels and the production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in the presence of daylight are likely to have driven a need to evolve circadian rhythms to preempt , and therefore counteract , damaging redox reactions on a daily basis .
carnivore and herbivore diets are contrasting , with basic nitrogen and carbon proportions vary for their particular foods . " the nitrogen content of plant tissues averages about 2 % , while in fungi , animals , and bacteria it averages about 5 % to 10 % . " many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose , while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies can not otherwise synthesize . all animals ' diets must provide sufficient amounts of the basic building blocks they need , up to the point where their particular biology can synthesize the rest . animal tissue contains chemical compounds , such as water , carbohydrates ( sugar , starch , and fiber ) , amino acids ( in proteins ) , fatty acids ( in lipids ) , and nucleic acids ( dna and rna ) . these compounds in turn consist of elements such as carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , phosphorus , calcium , iron , zinc , magnesium , manganese , and so on . all of these chemical compounds and elements occur in various forms and combinations ( e.g . hormones , vitamins , phospholipids , hydroxyapatite ) .
the government of punjab is a provincial government in the federal structure of pakistan , is based in lahore , the capital of the punjab province . the chief minister of punjab ( cm ) is elected by the provincial assembly of the punjab to serve as the head of the provincial government in punjab , pakistan . the current chief minister is shahbaz sharif , who became the chief minister of punjab as being restored after governor 's rule starting from 25 february 2009 to 30 march 2009 . thereafter got re-elected as a result of 11 may 2013 elections . the provincial assembly of the punjab is a unicameral legislature of elected representatives of the province of punjab , which is located in lahore in eastern pakistan . the assembly was established under article 106 of the constitution of pakistan as having a total of 371 seats , with 66 seats reserved for women and eight reserved for non-muslims .
the old oracles in delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood , and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration-prophecy existed in the temple . this led some scholars to the conclusion that pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries , according to the local tradition . in that regard , the mythical seeress sibyl of anatolian origin , with her ecstatic art , looks unrelated to the oracle itself . however , the greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel-leaves , which seem to be confirmed by recent studies .
on 2 march 1882 , roderick maclean , a disgruntled poet apparently offended by victoria 's refusal to accept one of his poems , shot at the queen as her carriage left windsor railway station . two schoolboys from eton college struck him with their umbrellas , until he was hustled away by a policeman . victoria was outraged when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity , but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack that she said it was " worth being shot at—to see how much one is loved " .
in the late 20th century a new concept was added to those included in the compass of both structure and function , the consideration of sustainability , hence sustainable architecture . to satisfy the contemporary ethos a building should be constructed in a manner which is environmentally friendly in terms of the production of its materials , its impact upon the natural and built environment of its surrounding area and the demands that it makes upon non-sustainable power sources for heating , cooling , water and waste management and lighting .
after dna replication is complete , the cell must physically separate the two copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells . :18.2 in prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission , in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the cytoplasm into two membrane-bound portions . binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes . eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle ; dna replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as s phase , whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during m phase . :18.1
on 12 december 1911 , during the delhi durbar , george v , then emperor of india , along with queen mary , his consort , made the announcement that the capital of the raj was to be shifted from calcutta to delhi , while laying the foundation stone for the viceroy 's residence in the coronation park , kingsway camp . the foundation stone of new delhi was laid by king george v and queen mary at the site of delhi durbar of 1911 at kingsway camp on 15 december 1911 , during their imperial visit . large parts of new delhi were planned by edwin lutyens ( sir edwin from 1918 ) , who first visited delhi in 1912 , and herbert baker ( sir herbert from 1926 ) , both leading 20th-century british architects . the contract was given to sobha singh ( later sir sobha singh ) . construction really began after world war i and was completed by 1931 . the city that was later dubbed " lutyens ' delhi " was inaugurated in ceremonies beginning on 10 february 1931 by lord irwin , the viceroy . lutyens designed the central administrative area of the city as a testament to britain 's imperial aspirations .
nasser 's nationalization of the suez canal and his emergence as the political victor from the subsequent suez crisis substantially elevated his popularity in egypt and the arab world . calls for pan-arab unity under his leadership increased , culminating with the formation of the united arab republic with syria ( 1958–1961 ) . in 1962 , nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in egypt . despite setbacks to his pan-arabist cause , by 1963 nasser 's supporters gained power in several arab countries and he became embroiled in the north yemen civil war . he began his second presidential term in march 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running . following egypt 's defeat by israel in the 1967 six-day war , nasser resigned , but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement . by 1968 , nasser had appointed himself prime minister , launched the war of attrition to regain lost territory , began a process of depoliticizing the military , and issued a set of political liberalization reforms . after the conclusion of the 1970 arab league summit , nasser suffered a heart attack and died . his funeral in cairo drew five million mourners and an outpouring of grief across the arab world .
the brazilian federal constitution states that the power to enter into treaties is vested in the president and that such treaties must be approved by congress ( articles 84 , clause viii , and 49 , clause i ) . in practice , this has been interpreted as meaning that the executive branch is free to negotiate and sign a treaty , but its ratification by the president is contingent upon the prior approval of congress . additionally , the federal supreme court has ruled that , following ratification and entry into force , a treaty must be incorporated into domestic law by means of a presidential decree published in the federal register in order to be valid in brazil and applicable by the brazilian authorities .
on march 30 , 2015 , it was announced that west is a co-owner , with various other music artists , in the music streaming service tidal . the service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos . jay z acquired the parent company of tidal , aspiro , in the first quarter of 2015 . including beyoncé and jay-z , sixteen artist stakeholders ( such as rihanna , beyoncé , madonna , chris martin , nicki minaj and more ) co-own tidal , with the majority owning a 3 % equity stake . the idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry , and to rival other streaming services such as spotify , which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties . " the challenge is to get everyone to respect music again , to recognize its value " , stated jay-z on the release of tidal .
within the diasporan armenian community , there is an unofficial classification of the different kinds of armenians . for example , armenians who originate from iran are referred to as parskahay ( պարսկահայ ) , while armenians from lebanon are usually referred to as lipananahay ( լիբանանահայ ) . armenians of the diaspora are the primary speakers of the western dialect of the armenian language . this dialect has considerable differences with eastern armenian , but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other . eastern armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in iran and european countries such as ukraine , russia , and georgia ( where they form a majority in the samtskhe-javakheti province ) . in diverse communities ( such as in canada and the u.s. ) where many different kinds of armenians live together , there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together .
the independence of the thirteen colonies in north america in 1783 after the american war of independence caused britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies . british attention soon turned towards asia , africa , and the pacific . after the defeat of france in the revolutionary and napoleonic wars ( 1792–1815 ) , britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century ( with london the largest city in the world from about 1830 ) . unchallenged at sea , british dominance was later described as pax britannica ( " british peace " ) , a period of relative peace in europe and the world ( 1815–1914 ) during which the british empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman . in the early 19th century , the industrial revolution began to transform britain ; by the time of the great exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the " workshop of the world " . the british empire expanded to include india , large parts of africa and many other territories throughout the world . alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies , british dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions , such as asia and latin america . domestically , political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise . during this century , the population increased at a dramatic rate , accompanied by rapid urbanisation , causing significant social and economic stresses . to seek new markets and sources of raw materials , the conservative party under disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in egypt , south africa , and elsewhere . canada , australia , and new zealand became self-governing dominions .
according to walter gratzer , the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century bc . in china , the concept of qi developed , a spirit or " wind " similar to what western europeans later called pneuma . food was classified into " hot " ( for example , meats , blood , ginger , and hot spices ) and " cold " ( green vegetables ) in china , india , malaya , and persia . humours developed perhaps first in china alongside qi . ho the physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements ( wu xing : fire , water , earth , wood , and metal ) , and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets . about the same time in italy , alcmaeon of croton ( a greek ) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out , and warned that imbalance would result disease marked by obesity or emaciation .
when the book was released , reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts , and opinion was mixed about lee 's ability to connect them . the first part of the novel concerns the children 's fascination with boo radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood . reviewers were generally charmed by scout and jem 's observations of their quirky neighbors . one writer was so impressed by lee 's detailed explanations of the people of maycomb that he categorized the book as southern romantic regionalism . this sentimentalism can be seen in lee 's representation of the southern caste system to explain almost every character 's behavior in the novel . scout 's aunt alexandra attributes maycomb 's inhabitants ' faults and advantages to genealogy ( families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks ) , and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the finch family history and the history of maycomb . this regionalist theme is further reflected in mayella ewell 's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward tom robinson , and scout 's definition of " fine folks " being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have . the south itself , with its traditions and taboos , seems to drive the plot more than the characters .
on november 10 , 2007 , at approximately 7:35 pm , paramedics responding to an emergency call transported west 's mother , donda west , to the nearby centinela freeman hospital in marina del rey , california . she was unresponsive in the emergency room , and after resuscitation attempts , doctors pronounced her dead at approximately 8:30 pm , at age 58 . the los angeles county coroner 's office said in january 2008 that west had died of heart disease while suffering " multiple post-operative factors " after plastic surgery . she had undergone liposuction and breast reduction . beverly hills plastic surgeon andre aboolian had refused to do the surgery because west had a health condition that placed her at risk for a heart attack . aboolian referred her to an internist to investigate her cardiac issue . she never met with the doctor recommended by aboolian and had the procedures performed by a third doctor , jan adams .
in the mid-1950s , frank burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by niels jerne , formulated the clonal selection theory ( cst ) of immunity . on the basis of cst , burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction : " self " constituents ( constituents of the body ) do not trigger destructive immune responses , while " nonself " entities ( e.g. , pathogens , an allograft ) trigger a destructive immune response . the theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex " two-signal " activation of t cells . the self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized , but remain very influential .
china 's first imperial dynasty was the qin dynasty ( 221–206 bc ) . the qin unified the chinese warring states by conquest , but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor qin shi huangdi . within four years , the dynasty 's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion . two former rebel leaders , xiang yu ( d. 202 bc ) of chu and liu bang ( d. 195 bc ) of han , engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of china , which had fissured into 18 kingdoms , each claiming allegiance to either xiang yu or liu bang . although xiang yu proved to be a capable commander , liu bang defeated him at battle of gaixia ( 202 bc ) , in modern-day anhui . liu bang assumed the title " emperor " ( huangdi ) at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as emperor gaozu ( r. 202–195 bc ) . chang'an was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under han .
on 14 july , iraqi army officers abdel karim qasim and abdel salam aref overthrew the iraqi monarchy and , the next day , iraqi prime minister and nasser 's chief arab antagonist , nuri al-said , was killed . nasser recognized the new government and stated that " any attack on iraq was tantamount to an attack on the uar " . on 15 july , us marines landed in lebanon , and british special forces in jordan , upon the request of those countries ' governments to prevent them from falling to pro-nasser forces . nasser felt that the revolution in iraq left the road for pan-arab unity unblocked . on 19 july , for the first time , he declared that he was opting for full arab union , although he had no plan to merge iraq with the uar . while most members of the iraqi revolutionary command council ( rcc ) favored iraqi-uar unity , qasim sought to keep iraq independent and resented nasser 's large popular base in the country .
aerobic gymnastics ( formally sport aerobics ) involves the performance of routines by individuals , pairs , trios or groups up to 6 people , emphasizing strength , flexibility , and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills . routines are performed for all individuals on a 7x7m floor and also for 12–14 and 15-17 trios and mixed pairs . from 2009 , all senior trios and mixed pairs were required to be on the larger floor ( 10x10m ) , all groups also perform on this floor . routines generally last 60–90 seconds depending on age of participant and routine category .
soon after the passing of the 1931 act , in the book published on the occasion of the institute 's centenary celebration in 1934 , harry barnes , friba , chairman of the registration committee , mentioned that arcuk could not be a rival of any architectural association , least of all the riba , given the way arcuk was constituted . barnes commented that the act 's purpose was not protecting the architectural profession , and that the legitimate interests of the profession were best served by the ( then ) architectural associations in which some 80 per cent of those practising architecture were to be found .
as prosperity began to return in the 1980s , the city was stunned by the wah mee massacre in 1983 , when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the international district , seattle 's chinatown . beginning with microsoft 's 1979 move from albuquerque , new mexico to nearby bellevue , washington , seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including amazon.com , realnetworks , nintendo of america , mccaw cellular ( now part of at & t mobility ) , voicestream ( now t-mobile ) , and biomedical corporations such as heartstream ( later purchased by philips ) , heart technologies ( later purchased by boston scientific ) , physio-control ( later purchased by medtronic ) , zymogenetics , icos ( later purchased by eli lilly and company ) and immunex ( later purchased by amgen ) . this success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000 , and saw seattle 's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country . in 1993 , the movie sleepless in seattle brought the city further national attention . many of the seattle area 's tech companies remained relatively strong , but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001 .
in the early 20th century , the vast conscription of italian men from all throughout italy during world war i is credited with facilitating the diffusion of standard italian among less educated italian men , as these men from various regions with various regional languages were forced to communicate with each other in a common tongue while serving in the italian military . with the eventual spread of the radio and television throughout italy and the establishment of public education , italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to standard italian , while literacy rates among all social classes improved . today , the majority of italians are able to speak standard italian , though many italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language , especially at home with family or when communicating with italians from the same town or region . however , to some italians , speaking a regional language , especially in a formal setting or outside of one 's region , may carry a stigma or negative connotations associated with being lower class , uneducated , boorish , or overly informal .
in signal processing , data compression , source coding , or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation . compression can be either lossy or lossless . lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy . no information is lost in lossless compression . lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary information and removing it . the process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression . in the context of data transmission , it is called source coding ( encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted ) in opposition to channel coding .
the predominant religion is southern europe is christianity . christianity spread throughout southern europe during the roman empire , and christianity was adopted as the official religion of the roman empire in the year 380 ad . due to the historical break of the christian church into the western half based in rome and the eastern half based in constantinople , different branches of christianity are prodominent in different parts of europe . christians in the western half of southern europe — e.g. , portugal , spain , italy — are generally roman catholic . christians in the eastern half of southern europe — e.g. , greece , macedonia — are generally greek orthodox .
delicate sounds and fine overtones were mostly lost , because it took a lot of sound energy to vibrate the recording horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism . there were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system . some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances . even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn , notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback . toward the end of the acoustic era , there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns .
even though , both kashmir shaivism and advaita vedanta are non-dual philosophies which give primacy to universal consciousness ( chit or brahman ) , in kashmir shavisim , as opposed to advaita , all things are a manifestation of this consciousness . this implies that from the point of view of kashmir shavisim , the phenomenal world ( śakti ) is real , and it exists and has its being in consciousness ( chit ) . whereas , advaita holds that brahman is inactive ( niṣkriya ) and the phenomenal world is an illusion ( māyā ) . the objective of human life , according to kashmir shaivism , is to merge in shiva or universal consciousness , or to realize one 's already existing identity with shiva , by means of wisdom , yoga and grace .
according to 16th-century mystic rabbi elijah of chelm , ashkenazi jews lived in jerusalem during the 11th century . the story is told that a german-speaking palestinian jew saved the life of a young german man surnamed dolberger . so when the knights of the first crusade came to siege jerusalem , one of dolberger 's family members who was among them rescued jews in palestine and carried them back to worms to repay the favor . further evidence of german communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakhic questions sent from germany to jerusalem during the second half of the 11th century .
in 1845 , ireland was hit by a potato blight . in the next four years over a million irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the great famine . in ireland , victoria was labelled " the famine queen " . she personally donated £2,000 to famine relief , more than any other individual donor , and also supported the maynooth grant to a roman catholic seminary in ireland , despite protestant opposition . the story that she donated only £5 in aid to the irish , and on the same day gave the same amount to battersea dogs home , was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century .
although some indigenous peoples of the americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers—and many , especially in amazonia , still are—many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture . the impact of their agricultural endowment to the world is a testament to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the americas . although some societies depended heavily on agriculture , others practiced a mix of farming , hunting , and gathering . in some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture , large-scale organized cities , chiefdoms , states , and empires .
changing clocks and dst rules has a direct economic cost , entailing extra work to support remote meetings , computer applications and the like . for example , a 2007 north american rule change cost an estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion , and utah state university economist william f. shughart ii has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $ 1.7 billion usd . although it has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency , and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $ 31 billion on us stock exchanges , the estimated numbers depend on the methodology . the results have been disputed , and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers .
in 1950 , von neumann became a consultant to the weapons systems evaluation group ( wseg ) , whose function was to advise the joint chiefs of staff and the united states secretary of defense on the development and use of new technologies . he also became an adviser to the armed forces special weapons project ( afswp ) , which was responsible for the military aspects on nuclear weapons.over the following two years , he also became a consultant to the central intelligence agency ( cia ) , a member of the influential general advisory committee of the atomic energy commission , a consultant to the newly established lawrence livermore national laboratory , and a member of the scientific advisory group of the united states air force .
in ireland , pubs are known for their atmosphere or " craic " . in irish , a pub is referred to as teach tábhairne ( " tavernhouse " ) or teach óil ( " drinkinghouse " ) . live music , either sessions of traditional irish music or varieties of modern popular music , is frequently featured in the pubs of ireland . pubs in northern ireland are largely identical to their counterparts in the republic of ireland except for the lack of spirit grocers . a side effect of " the troubles " was that the lack of a tourist industry meant that a higher proportion of traditional bars have survived the wholesale refitting of irish pub interiors in the 'english style ' in the 1950s and 1960s . new zealand sports a number of irish pubs .
nasser 's egyptian detractors considered him a dictator who thwarted democratic progress , imprisoned thousands of dissidents , and led a repressive administration responsible for numerous human rights violations . islamists in egypt , particularly members of the politically persecuted brotherhood , viewed nasser as oppressive , tyrannical , and demonic . liberal writer tawfiq al-hakim described nasser as a " confused sultan " who employed stirring rhetoric , but had no actual plan to achieve his stated goals .
after the japanese attack on pearl harbor , eisenhower was assigned to the general staff in washington , where he served until june 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat japan and germany . he was appointed deputy chief in charge of pacific defenses under the chief of war plans division ( wpd ) , general leonard t. gerow , and then succeeded gerow as chief of the war plans division . next , he was appointed assistant chief of staff in charge of the new operations division ( which replaced wpd ) under chief of staff general george c. marshall , who spotted talent and promoted accordingly .
the city 's elevation is 2,643 ft ( 806 m ) above sea level ( as measured at the tucson international airport ) . tucson is situated on an alluvial plain in the sonoran desert , surrounded by five minor ranges of mountains : the santa catalina mountains and the tortolita mountains to the north , the santa rita mountains to the south , the rincon mountains to the east , and the tucson mountains to the west . the high point of the santa catalina mountains is 9,157 ft ( 2,791 m ) mount lemmon , the southernmost ski destination in the continental u.s. , while the tucson mountains include 4,687 ft ( 1,429 m ) wasson peak . the highest point in the area is mount wrightson , found in the santa rita mountains at 9,453 ft ( 2,881 m ) above sea level .
herman goldstine wrote : " one of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall . as far as i could tell , von neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim ; moreover , he could do it years later without hesitation . he could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into english . on one occasion i tested his ability by asking him to tell me how a tale of two cities started . whereupon , without any pause , he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes . " ulam noted that von neumann 's way of thinking might not be visual , but more of an aural one .
the american lunar module was finally ready for a successful piloted test flight in low earth orbit on apollo 9 in march 1969 . the next mission , apollo 10 , conducted a " dress rehearsal " for the first landing in may 1969 , flying the lm in lunar orbit as close as 47,400 feet ( 14.4 km ) above the surface , the point where the powered descent to the surface would begin . with the lm proven to work well , the next step was to attempt the actual landing .
people of irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in the city , making up 15.8 % of the population , followed by italians , accounting for 8.3 % of the population . people of west indian and caribbean ancestry are another sizable group , at 6.0 % , about half of whom are of haitian ancestry . over 27,000 chinese americans made their home in boston city proper in 2013 , and the city hosts a growing chinatown accommodating heavily traveled chinese-owned bus lines to and from chinatown , manhattan . some neighborhoods , such as dorchester , have received an influx of people of vietnamese ancestry in recent decades . neighborhoods such as jamaica plain and roslindale have experienced a growing number of dominican americans . the city and greater area also has a growing immigrant population of south asians , including the tenth-largest indian community in the country .
there are diverse interpretations of christianity which sometimes conflict . however , " whatever else they might disagree about , christians are at least united in believing that jesus has a unique significance . " the term " christian " is also used adjectivally to describe anything associated with christianity , or in a proverbial sense " all that is noble , and good , and christ-like . " it is also used as a label to identify people who associate with the cultural aspects of christianity , irrespective of personal religious beliefs or practices .
calculating that no further russian advance was likely until 1758 , frederick moved the bulk of his eastern forces to pomerania under the command of marshal lehwaldt where they were to repel the swedish invasion . in short order , the prussian army drove the swedes back , occupied most of swedish pomerania , and blockaded its capital stralsund . george ii of great britain , on the advice of his british ministers , revoked the convention of klosterzeven , and hanover reentered the war . over the winter the new commander of the hanoverian forces , duke ferdinand of brunswick , regrouped his army and launched a series of offensives that drove the french back across the river rhine . the british had suffered further defeats in north america , particularly at fort william henry . at home , however , stability had been established . since 1756 , successive governments led by newcastle and pitt had fallen . in august 1757 , the two men agreed to a political partnership and formed a coalition government that gave new , firmer direction to the war effort . the new strategy emphasised both newcastle 's commitment to british involvement on the continent , particularly in defence of germany , and william pitt 's determination to use naval power to seize french colonies around the globe . this " dual strategy " would dominate british policy for the next five years .
23-year-old candice glover won the season with kree harrison taking the runner-up spot . glover is the first female to win american idol since jordin sparks . glover released " i am beautiful " as a single while harrison released " all cried out " immediately after the show . glover sold poorly with her debut album , and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label .
in the general election , against the advice of his advisors , eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the south , refusing to surrender the region to the democratic party . the campaign strategy , dubbed " k1c2 " , was to focus on attacking the truman and roosevelt administrations on three issues : korea , communism and corruption . in an effort to accommodate the right , he stressed that the liberation of eastern europe should be by peaceful means only ; he also distanced himself from his former boss president truman .
new haven lies at the intersection of interstate 95 on the coast—which provides access southwards and/or westwards to the western coast of connecticut and to new york city , and eastwards to the eastern connecticut shoreline , rhode island , and eastern massachusetts—and interstate 91 , which leads northward to the interior of massachusetts and vermont and the canadian border . i-95 is infamous for traffic jams increasing with proximity to new york city ; on the east side of new haven it passes over the quinnipiac river via the pearl harbor memorial , or " q bridge " , which often presents a major bottleneck to traffic . i-91 , however , is relatively less congested , except at the intersection with i-95 during peak travel times .
to the north , the sahara skirts the mediterranean sea in egypt and portions of libya , but in cyrenaica and the maghreb , the sahara borders the mediterranean forest , woodland , and scrub ecoregions of northern africa , all of which have a mediterranean climate characterized by hot summers and cool and rainy winters . according to the botanical criteria of frank white and geographer robert capot-rey , the northern limit of the sahara corresponds to the northern limit of date palm cultivation and the southern limit of the range of esparto , a grass typical of the mediterranean climate portion of the maghreb and iberia . the northern limit also corresponds to the 100 mm ( 3.9 in ) isohyet of annual precipitation .
despite odds of four to one , the iii corps launched a risky attack . the french were routed and the iii corps captured vionville , blocking any further escape attempts to the west . once blocked from retreat , the french in the fortress of metz had no choice but to engage in a fight that would see the last major cavalry engagement in western europe . the battle soon erupted , and iii corps was shattered by incessant cavalry charges , losing over half its soldiers . the german official history recorded 15,780 casualties and french casualties of 13,761 men .
many traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times , which included climbing the city wall on january 16 , bathing in qing xi on march 3 , hill hiking on september 9 and others ( the dates are in chinese lunar calendar ) . almost none of them , however , are still celebrated by modern nanjingese .
the polish nobility enjoyed many rights that were not available to the noble classes of other countries and , typically , each new monarch conceded them further privileges . those privileges became the basis of the golden liberty in the polish–lithuanian commonwealth . despite having a king , poland was called the nobility 's commonwealth because the king was elected by all interested members of hereditary nobility and poland was considered to be the property of this class , not of the king or the ruling dynasty . this state of affairs grew up in part because of the extinction of the male-line descendants of the old royal dynasty ( first the piasts , then the jagiellons ) , and the selection by the nobility of the polish king from among the dynasty 's female-line descendants .
myanmar ( myan-mar i/miɑːnˈmɑːr/ mee-ahn-mar , /miˈɛnmɑːr/ mee-en-mar or /maɪˈænmɑːr/ my-an-mar ( also with the stress on first syllable ) ; burmese pronunciation : [ mjəmà ] ) , [ nb 1 ] officially the republic of the union of myanmar and also known as burma , is a sovereign state in southeast asia bordered by bangladesh , india , china , laos and thailand . one-third of myanmar 's total perimeter of 1,930 km ( 1,200 miles ) forms an uninterrupted coastline along the bay of bengal and the andaman sea . the country 's 2014 census revealed a much lower population than expected , with 51 million people recorded . myanmar is 676,578 square kilometres ( 261,227 sq mi ) in size . its capital city is naypyidaw and its largest city is yangon ( rangoon ) .
in 1906 , the tungsten filament was introduced . tungsten metal was initially not available in a form that allowed it to be drawn into fine wires . filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile . by 1910 , a process was developed by william d. coolidge at general electric for production of a ductile form of tungsten . the process required pressing tungsten powder into bars , then several steps of sintering , swaging , and then wire drawing . it was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use , and that a very small " doping " treatment with potassium , silicon , and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments .
gorbachev also radically expanded the scope of glasnost , stating that no subject was off-limits for open discussion in the media . even so , the cautious soviet intelligentsia took almost a year to begin pushing the boundaries to see if he meant what he said . for the first time , the communist party leader had appealed over the heads of central committee members for the people 's support in exchange for expansion of liberties . the tactic proved successful : within two years political reform could no longer be sidetracked by party " conservatives . " an unintended consequence was that having saved reform , gorbachev 's move ultimately killed the very system it was designed to save .
if any boy produces an outstanding piece of work , it may be " sent up for good " , storing the effort in the college archives for posterity . this award has been around since the 18th century . as sending up for good is fairly infrequent , the process is rather mysterious to many of eton 's boys . first , the master wishing to send up for good must gain the permission of the relevant head of department . upon receiving his or her approval , the piece of work will be marked with sent up for good and the student will receive a card to be signed by house master , tutor and division master .
he was killed on 2 march 2009 , possibly by soldiers in retaliation for the assassination of general batista tagme na waie , the head of the joint chiefs of staff , killed in an explosion . vieira 's death did not trigger widespread violence , but there were signs of turmoil in the country , according to the advocacy group swisspeace . malam bacai sanhá was elected after a transition . in the 2009 election to replace the assassinated vieira , sanhá was the presidential candidate of the paigc while kumba ialá was the presidential candidate of the prs .
he invited a roman catholic priest , father anselm strittmatter , o.s.b. , to visit him for consultation . von neumann reportedly said in explanation that pascal had a point , referring to pascal 's wager . father strittmatter administered the last sacraments to him . some of von neumann 's friends ( such as abraham pais and oskar morgenstern ) said they had always believed him to be " completely agnostic . " " of this deathbed conversion , morgenstern told heims , " he was of course completely agnostic all his life , and then he suddenly turned catholic—it does n't agree with anything whatsoever in his attitude , outlook and thinking when he was healthy . " father strittmatter recalled that von neumann did not receive much peace or comfort from it , as he still remained terrified of death .
in the early days of association football , known simply as football or soccer , friendly matches ( or " friendlies " ) were the most common type of match . however , since the development of the football league in england in 1888 , league tournaments became established , in addition to lengthy derby and cup tournaments . by the year 2000 , national leagues were established in almost every country throughout the world , as well as local or regional leagues for lower level teams , thus the significance of friendlies has seriously declined since the 19th century .
louis ' advisors believed that , as long as strasbourg remained independent , it would endanger the king 's newly annexed territories in alsace , and , that to defend these large rural lands effectively , a garrison had to be placed in towns such as strasbourg . indeed , the bridge over the rhine at strasbourg had been used repeatedly by imperial ( holy roman empire ) forces , and three times during the franco-dutch war strasbourg had served as a gateway for imperial invasions into alsace . in september 1681 louis ' forces , though lacking a clear casus belli , surrounded the city with overwhelming force . after some negotiation , louis marched into the city unopposed on 30 september 1681 and proclaimed its annexation .
the rivalry between nintendo and sega resulted in what has been described as one of the most notable console wars in video game history , in which sega positioned the genesis as the " cool " console , with more mature titles aimed at older gamers , and edgy advertisements that occasionally attacked the competition . nintendo however , scored an early public relations advantage by securing the first console conversion of capcom 's arcade classic street fighter ii for snes , which took over a year to make the transition to genesis . despite the genesis 's head start , much larger library of games , and lower price point , the genesis only represented an estimated 60 % of the american 16-bit console market in june 1992 , and neither console could maintain a definitive lead for several years . donkey kong country is said to have helped establish the snes 's market prominence in the latter years of the 16-bit generation , and for a time , maintain against the playstation and saturn . according to nintendo , the company had sold more than 20 million snes units in the u.s . according to a 2014 wedbush securities report based on npd sales data , the snes ultimately outsold the genesis in the u.s. market .
from 1952 to 1964 , most voters were registered democrats , but the state voted for the republican presidential candidate in every election except for 1964 . the following year , congress passed and president lyndon b. johnson signed the voting rights act of 1965 , providing for oversight of state practices and enforcement of constitutional voting rights for african americans and other minorities in order to prevent the discrimination and disenfranchisement that had excluded most of them for decades from the political process .
after the american revolutionary war , the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the north and the south as slaves were freed . most northern states abolished slavery , sometimes , like new york , in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed . the last slaves in new york were not freed until 1827 . in connection with the second great awakening , quaker and methodist preachers in the south urged slaveholders to free their slaves . revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves , some by deed and others by will , so that from 1782 to 1810 , the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the south .
throughout history , many rulers , empires and nations have oppressed their jewish populations or sought to eliminate them entirely . methods employed ranged from expulsion to outright genocide ; within nations , often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent . the history of antisemitism includes the first crusade which resulted in the massacre of jews ; the spanish inquisition ( led by tomás de torquemada ) and the portuguese inquisition , with their persecution and autos-da-fé against the new christians and marrano jews ; the bohdan chmielnicki cossack massacres in ukraine ; the pogroms backed by the russian tsars ; as well as expulsions from spain , portugal , england , france , germany , and other countries in which the jews had settled . according to a 2008 study published in the american journal of human genetics , 19.8 % of the modern iberian population has sephardic jewish ancestry , indicating that the number of conversos may have been much higher than originally thought .
each code point has a single general category property . the major categories are : letter , mark , number , punctuation , symbol , separator and other . within these categories , there are subdivisions . the general category is not useful for every use , since legacy encodings have used multiple characteristics per single code point . e.g. , u+000a < control-000a > line feed ( lf ) in ascii is both a control and a formatting separator ; in unicode the general category is " other , control " . often , other properties must be used to specify the characteristics and behaviour of a code point . the possible general categories are :
the chinese intervention in late october 1950 bolstered the korean people 's air force ( kpaf ) of north korea with the mig-15 , one of the world 's most advanced jet fighters . the fast , heavily armed mig outflew first-generation un jets such as the f-80 ( united states air force ) and gloster meteors ( royal australian air force ) , posing a real threat to b-29 superfortress bombers even under fighter escort . fearful of confronting the united states directly , the soviet union denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role , but air combat quickly resulted in soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in russian . this known direct soviet participation was a casus belli that the un command deliberately overlooked , lest the war for the korean peninsula expand to include the soviet union , and potentially escalate into atomic warfare .
utrecht is well-connected to the dutch road network . two of the most important major roads serve the city of utrecht : the a12 and a2 motorways connect amsterdam , arnhem , the hague and maastricht , as well as belgium and germany . other major motorways in the area are the almere–breda a27 and the utrecht–groningen a28 . due to the increasing traffic and the ancient city plan , traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around utrecht , causing elevated levels of air pollutants . this has led to a passionate debate in the city about the best way to improve the city 's air quality .
there do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for the age of the solar system . these resonances occur when neptune 's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object , such as 1:2 , or 3:4 . if , say , an object orbits the sun once for every two neptune orbits , it will only complete half an orbit by the time neptune returns to its original position . the most heavily populated resonance in the kuiper belt , with over 200 known objects , is the 2:3 resonance . objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of neptune , and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known kuiper belt objects , pluto , is among them . although pluto crosses neptune 's orbit regularly , the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide . the 3:4 , 3:5 , 4:7 and 2:5 resonances are less populated .
there are many important organozinc compounds . organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties , synthesis and reactions . among important applications is the frankland-duppa reaction in which an oxalate ester ( rococoor ) reacts with an alkyl halide r'x , zinc and hydrochloric acid to the α-hydroxycarboxylic esters rr'cohcoor , the reformatskii reaction which converts α-halo-esters and aldehydes to β-hydroxy-esters , the simmons–smith reaction in which the carbenoid ( iodomethyl ) zinc iodide reacts with alkene ( or alkyne ) and converts them to cyclopropane , the addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds . the barbier reaction ( 1899 ) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium grignard reaction and is better of the two . in presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail , whereas the barbier reaction can even take place in water . on the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than grignards , are expensive and difficult to handle . commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc , diethylzinc and diphenylzinc . in one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors :
most birds can fly , which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes . flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding , feeding , and predator avoidance and escape . birds have various adaptations for flight , including a lightweight skeleton , two large flight muscles , the pectoralis ( which accounts for 15 % of the total mass of the bird ) and the supracoracoideus , as well as a modified forelimb ( wing ) that serves as an aerofoil . wing shape and size generally determine a bird species ' type of flight ; many birds combine powered , flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight . about 60 extant bird species are flightless , as were many extinct birds . flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands , probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators . though flightless , penguins use similar musculature and movements to " fly " through the water , as do auks , shearwaters and dippers .
independent service is a special service mode found on most elevators . it is activated by a key switch either inside the elevator itself or on a centralized control panel in the lobby . when an elevator is placed on independent service , it will no longer respond to hall calls . ( in a bank of elevators , traffic is rerouted to the other elevators , while in a single elevator , the hall buttons are disabled ) . the elevator will remain parked on a floor with its doors open until a floor is selected and the door close button is held until the elevator starts to travel . independent service is useful when transporting large goods or moving groups of people between certain floors .
public demand caused the government in october 1940 to build new deep shelters:189–190 within the underground to hold 80,000 people but were not completed until the period of heaviest bombing had passed . by the end of 1940 significant improvements had been made in the underground and in many other large shelters . authorities provided stoves and bathrooms and canteen trains provided food . tickets were issued for bunks in large shelters to reduce the amount of time spent queuing . committees quickly formed within shelters as informal governments , and organisations such as the british red cross and the salvation army worked to improve conditions . entertainment included concerts , films , plays and books from local libraries .
thus , in less than twenty years , rome had destroyed the power of one of the successor states , crippled another , and firmly entrenched its influence over greece . this was primarily a result of the over-ambition of the macedonian kings , and their unintended provocation of rome ; though rome was quick to exploit the situation . in another twenty years , the macedonian kingdom was no more . seeking to re-assert macedonian power and greek independence , philip v 's son perseus incurred the wrath of the romans , resulting in the third macedonian war ( 171–168 bc ) . victorious , the romans abolished the macedonian kingdom , replacing it with four puppet republics ; these lasted a further twenty years before macedon was formally annexed as a roman province ( 146 bc ) after yet another rebellion under andriscus . rome now demanded that the achaean league , the last stronghold of greek independence , be dissolved . the achaeans refused and declared war on rome . most of the greek cities rallied to the achaeans ' side , even slaves were freed to fight for greek independence . the roman consul lucius mummius advanced from macedonia and defeated the greeks at corinth , which was razed to the ground . in 146 bc , the greek peninsula , though not the islands , became a roman protectorate . roman taxes were imposed , except in athens and sparta , and all the cities had to accept rule by rome 's local allies .
the literal meaning of durbar square is a " place of palaces " . there are three preserved durbar squares in kathmandu valley and one unpreserved in kirtipur . the durbar square of kathmandu is located in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms ( kantipur , lalitpur , bhaktapur , kirtipur ) ; the earliest is the licchavi dynasty . the complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the durbar square . the outer quadrangle has the kasthamandap , kumari ghar , and shiva-parvati temple ; the inner quadrangle has the hanuman dhoka palace . the squares were severely damaged in the april 2015 nepal earthquake .
hanover 's leading cabaret-stage is the gop variety theatre which is located in the georgs palace . some other famous cabaret-stages are the variety marlene , the uhu-theatre . the theatre die hinterbühne , the rampenlich variety and the revue-stage tak . the most important cabaret-event is the kleines fest im großen garten ( little festival in the great garden ) which is the most successful cabaret festival in germany . it features artists from around the world . some other important events are the calenberger cabaret weeks , the hanover cabaret festival and the wintervariety .
in terms of the newline , unicode introduced u+2028 line separator and u+2029 paragraph separator . this was an attempt to provide a unicode solution to encoding paragraphs and lines semantically , potentially replacing all of the various platform solutions . in doing so , unicode does provide a way around the historical platform dependent solutions . nonetheless , few if any unicode solutions have adopted these unicode line and paragraph separators as the sole canonical line ending characters . however , a common approach to solving this issue is through newline normalization . this is achieved with the cocoa text system in mac os x and also with w3c xml and html recommendations . in this approach every possible newline character is converted internally to a common newline ( which one does not really matter since it is an internal operation just for rendering ) . in other words , the text system can correctly treat the character as a newline , regardless of the input 's actual encoding .
on july 1 , 1988 , the fourth and last day of a bruising 19th party conference , gorbachev won the backing of the tired delegates for his last-minute proposal to create a new supreme legislative body called the congress of people 's deputies . frustrated by the old guard 's resistance , gorbachev embarked on a set of constitutional changes to try to separate party and state , and thereby isolate his conservative party opponents . detailed proposals for the new congress of people 's deputies were published on october 2 , 1988 , and to enable the creation of the new legislature the supreme soviet , during its november 29–december 1 , 1988 , session , implemented amendments to the 1977 soviet constitution , enacted a law on electoral reform , and set the date of the election for march 26 , 1989 .
italy became a major industrialized country again , due to its post-war economic miracle . the european union ( eu ) involved the division of powers , with taxation , health and education handled by the nation states , while the eu had charge of market rules , competition , legal standards and environmentalism . the soviet economic and political system collapsed , leading to the end of communism in the satellite countries in 1989 , and the dissolution of the soviet union itself in 1991 . as a consequence , europe 's integration deepened , the continent became depolarised , and the european union expanded to subsequently include many of the formerly communist european countries – romania and bulgaria ( 2007 ) and croatia ( 2013 ) .
in 1915 , as the russian caucasus army continued to advance into eastern anatolia , the ottoman government started the deportation of its ethnic armenian population , resulting in the death of approximately 1.5 million armenians in what became known as the armenian genocide . the genocide was carried out during and after world war i and implemented in two phases : the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the syrian desert . driven forward by military escorts , the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery , rape , and systematic massacre . large-scale massacres were also committed against the empire 's greek and assyrian minorities as part of the same campaign of ethnic cleansing .
the expansion of the order produced changes . a smaller emphasis on doctrinal activity favoured the development here and there of the ascetic and contemplative life and there sprang up , especially in germany and italy , the mystical movement with which the names of meister eckhart , heinrich suso , johannes tauler , and st. catherine of siena are associated . ( see german mysticism , which has also been called " dominican mysticism . " ) this movement was the prelude to the reforms undertaken , at the end of the century , by raymond of capua , and continued in the following century . it assumed remarkable proportions in the congregations of lombardy and the netherlands , and in the reforms of savonarola in florence .
after the incheon landing , the 1st cavalry division began its northward advance from the pusan perimeter . " task force lynch " ( after lieutenant colonel james h. lynch ) , 3rd battalion , 7th cavalry regiment , and two 70th tank battalion units ( charlie company and the intelligence–reconnaissance platoon ) effected the " pusan perimeter breakout " through 106.4 miles ( 171.2 km ) of enemy territory to join the 7th infantry division at osan . the x corps rapidly defeated the kpa defenders around seoul , thus threatening to trap the main kpa force in southern korea .
the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages . the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil , and contains both the national petroleum reserve–alaska and the prudhoe bay oil field . barrow , the northernmost city in the united states , is located here . the northwest arctic area , anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley , is often regarded as being part of this region . however , the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people .
adsl-broadband service is provided with maximum speeds of up to 1536 kbit/s downstream and 512 kbit/s upstream offered on contract levels from lite £16 per month to gold+ at £190 per month . there are a few public wifi hotspots in jamestown , which are also being operated by sure ( formerly cable & wireless ) .
since all contact between the wrestlers must cease if any part of the body is touching , or underneath , the ropes , many wrestlers will attempt to break submission holds by deliberately grabbing the bottom ropes . this is called a " rope break " , and it is one of the most common ways to break a submission hold . most holds leave an arm or leg free , so that the person can tap out if they want . instead , they use these free limbs to either grab one of the ring ropes ( the bottom one is the most common , as it is nearest the wrestlers , though other ropes sometimes are used for standing holds such as chris masters ' master lock ) or drape their foot across , or underneath one . once this has been accomplished , and the accomplishment is witnessed by the referee , the referee will demand that the offending wrestler break the hold , and start counting to five if the wrestler does not . if the referee reaches the count of five , and the wrestler still does not break the hold , they are disqualified .
the russian soviet federative socialist republic ( russian sfsr or rsfsr ; russian : российская советская федеративная социалистическая республика , tr . rossiyskaya sovetskaya federativnaya sotsialisticheskaya respublika listen ( help·info ) ) commonly referred to as soviet russia or simply as russia , was a sovereign state in 1917–22 , the largest , most populous , and most economically developed republic of the soviet union in 1922–91 and a sovereign part of the soviet union with its own legislation in 1990–91 . the republic comprised sixteen autonomous republics , five autonomous oblasts , ten autonomous okrugs , six krais , and forty oblasts . russians formed the largest ethnic group . to the west it bordered finland , norway and poland ; and to the south , china , mongolia and north korea whilst bordering the arctic ocean to the north , the pacific ocean to the east and the black sea and caspian sea to the south . within the ussr , it bordered the baltic republics ( lithuania , latvia and estonia ) , the byelorussian ssr and the ukrainian ssr to the west . to the south it bordered the georgian , azerbaijan and kazakh ssrs .
the term prime minister in the sense that we know it originated in the 18th century in the united kingdom when members of parliament disparagingly used the title in reference to sir robert walpole . over time , the title became honorific and remains so in the 21st century .
the coup completed , the rcc proceeded with their intentions of consolidating the revolutionary government and modernizing the country . they purged monarchists and members of idris ' senussi clan from libya 's political world and armed forces ; gaddafi believed this elite were opposed to the will of the libyan people and had to be expunged . " people 's courts " were founded to try various monarchist politicians and journalists , and though many were imprisoned , none were executed . idris was sentenced to execution in absentia .
in the late 13th and early 14th centuries , a process took place – primarily in italy but partly also in the empire – that historians have termed a 'commercial revolution ' . among the innovations of the period were new forms of partnership and the issuing of insurance , both of which contributed to reducing the risk of commercial ventures ; the bill of exchange and other forms of credit that circumvented the canonical laws for gentiles against usury , and eliminated the dangers of carrying bullion ; and new forms of accounting , in particular double-entry bookkeeping , which allowed for better oversight and accuracy .
on january 9 , 1957 , karachay autonomous oblast and chechen-ingush autonomous soviet socialist republic were restored by khrushchev and they were transferred from the georgian ssr back to the russian sfsr .
charles " wag " bennett , one of the judges at the 1966 competition , was impressed with schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him . as schwarzenegger had little money , bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in forest gate , london , england . yorton 's leg definition had been judged superior , and schwarzenegger , under a training program devised by bennett , concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs . staying in the east end of london helped schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the english language . also in 1966 , schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol reg park , who became his friend and mentor . the training paid off and , in 1967 , schwarzenegger won the title for the first time , becoming the youngest ever mr. universe at the age of 20 . he would go on to win the title a further three times . schwarzenegger then flew back to munich , training for four to six hours daily , attending business school and working in a health club ( rolf putziger 's gym where he worked and trained from 1966–1968 ) , returning in 1968 to london to win his next mr. universe title . he frequently told roger c. field , his english coach and friend in munich at that time , " i 'm going to become the greatest actor ! "
persistent heavy rain and landslides in wenchuan county and the nearby area badly affected rescue efforts . at the start of rescue operations on may 12 , 20 helicopters were deployed for the delivery of food , water , and emergency aid , and also the evacuation of the injured and reconnaissance of quake-stricken areas . by 17:37 cst on may 13 , a total of over 15,600 troops and militia reservists from the chengdu military region had joined the rescue force in the heavily affected areas . a commander reported from yingxiu town , wenchuan , that around 3,000 survivors were found , while the status of the other inhabitants ( around 9,000 ) remained unclear . the 1,300 rescuers reached the epicenter , and 300 pioneer troops reached the seat of wenchuan at about 23:30 cst . by 12:17 cst , may 14 , 2008 , communication in the seat of wenchuan was partly revived . on the afternoon of may 14 , 15 special operations troops , along with relief supplies and communications gear , parachuted into inaccessible mao county , northeast of wenchuan .
elizabeth was born in london to the duke and duchess of york , later king george vi and queen elizabeth , and was the elder of their two daughters . she was educated privately at home . her father acceded to the throne on the abdication of his brother edward viii in 1936 , from which time she was the heir presumptive . she began to undertake public duties during world war ii , serving in the auxiliary territorial service . in 1947 , she married philip , duke of edinburgh , with whom she has four children : charles , anne , andrew , and edward .
the word " dollar " is one of the words in the first paragraph of section 9 of article 1 of the u.s. constitution . in that context , " dollars " is a reference to the spanish milled dollar , a coin that had a monetary value of 8 spanish units of currency , or reales . in 1792 the u.s. congress adopted legislation titled an act establishing a mint , and regulating the coins of the united states . section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins , including " dollars or units—each to be of the value of a spanish milled dollar as the same is now current , and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure , or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver " . section 20 of the act provided , " that the money of account of the united states shall be expressed in dollars , or units ... and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the united states shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation " . in other words , this act designated the united states dollar as the unit of currency of the united states .
puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production , which in turn causes a number of physical changes . it is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics ( for example , a deeper voice and larger adam 's apple in boys , and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls ) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state . this is triggered by the pituitary gland , which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream , initiating a chain reaction to occur . the male and female gonads are subsequently activated , which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development ; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals . the testes primarily release testosterone , and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen . the production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met . some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones , tissue responsiveness or obesity .
in modern-day germany , the holy roman empire continued to rule , but the elective nature of the imperial crown meant there was no enduring dynasty around which a strong state could form . further east , the kingdoms of poland , hungary , and bohemia grew powerful . in iberia , the christian kingdoms continued to gain land from the muslim kingdoms of the peninsula ; portugal concentrated on expanding overseas during the 15th century , while the other kingdoms were riven by difficulties over royal succession and other concerns . after losing the hundred years ' war , england went on to suffer a long civil war known as the wars of the roses , which lasted into the 1490s and only ended when henry tudor ( r. 1485–1509 as henry vii ) became king and consolidated power with his victory over richard iii ( r. 1483–85 ) at bosworth in 1485 . in scandinavia , margaret i of denmark ( r. in denmark 1387–1412 ) consolidated norway , denmark , and sweden in the union of kalmar , which continued until 1523 . the major power around the baltic sea was the hanseatic league , a commercial confederation of city states that traded from western europe to russia . scotland emerged from english domination under robert the bruce ( r. 1306–29 ) , who secured papal recognition of his kingship in 1328 .
many us and european jewellery companies , including bulgari , tiffany , and cartier , refuse to import these stones based on reports of deplorable working conditions in the mines . human rights watch has encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all profits go to the ruling junta , as the majority of mining activity in the country is government-run . the government of myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines .
ancient egypt made significant advances in astronomy , mathematics and medicine . their development of geometry was a necessary outgrowth of surveying to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland , which was flooded annually by the nile river . the 3-4-5 right triangle and other rules of thumb were used to build rectilinear structures , and the post and lintel architecture of egypt . egypt was also a center of alchemy research for much of the mediterranean.the edwin smith papyrus is one of the first medical documents still extant , and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain : it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern neuroscience . however , while egyptian medicine had some effective practices , it was not without its ineffective and sometimes harmful practices . medical historians believe that ancient egyptian pharmacology , for example , was largely ineffective . nevertheless , it applies the following components to the treatment of disease : examination , diagnosis , treatment , and prognosis , which display strong parallels to the basic empirical method of science and according to g. e. r. lloyd played a significant role in the development of this methodology . the ebers papyrus ( c. 1550 bc ) also contains evidence of traditional empiricism .
the long-awaited takeover of universal pictures by mca , inc. happened in mid-1962 as part of the mca-decca records merger . the company reverted in name to universal pictures . as a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business , virtually every mca client was signed to a universal contract . in 1964 mca formed universal city studios , inc. , merging the motion pictures and television arms of universal pictures company and revue productions ( officially renamed as universal television in 1966 ) . and so , with mca in charge , universal became a full-blown , a-film movie studio , with leading actors and directors under contract ; offering slick , commercial films ; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964 . television production made up much of the studio 's output , with universal heavily committed , in particular , to deals with nbc ( which later merged with universal to form nbc universal ; see below ) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons . an innovation during this period championed by universal was the made-for-television movie .
on september 27 , 2006 schwarzenegger signed a bill creating the nation 's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions . the law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities , refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere . schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in california from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state 's greenhouse gas emission standards . the two bills are part of a plan to reduce california 's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020 . in 2005 , schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
the remaining band members recorded " independent women part i " , which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film , charlie 's angels . it became their best-charting single , topping the u.s . billboard hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks . in early 2001 , while destiny 's child was completing their third album , beyoncé landed a major role in the mtv made-for-television film , carmen : a hip hopera , starring alongside american actor mekhi phifer . set in philadelphia , the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th century opera carmen by french composer georges bizet . when the third album survivor was released in may 2001 , luckett and roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them . the album debuted at number one on the u.s . billboard 200 , with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold . the album spawned other number-one hits , " bootylicious " and the title track , " survivor " , the latter of which earned the group a grammy award for best r & b performance by a duo or group with vocals . after releasing their holiday album 8 days of christmas in october 2001 , the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers .
the mass of paul vi was also in latin but approval was given for the use of vernacular languages . there had been other instructions issued by the pope in 1964 , 1967 , 1968 , 1969 and 1970 which centered on the reform of all liturgies of the roman church . these major reforms were not welcomed by all and in all countries . the sudden apparent " outlawing " of the 400-year-old mass , the last typical edition of which being promulgated only a few years earlier in 1962 by paul 's predecessor , pope john xxiii , was not always explained well . further experimentation with the new mass by liturgists , such as the usage of pop/folk music ( as opposed to the gregorian chant advocated by pope pius x ) , along with concurrent changes in the order of sanctuaries , was viewed by some as vandalism . in 2007 , pope benedict xvi clarified that the 1962 mass of john xxiii and the 1970 mass of paul vi are two forms of the same roman rite , the first , which had never been " juridically abrogated " , now being an " extraordinary form of the roman rite " , while the other " obviously is and continues to be the normal form – the forma ordinaria – of the eucharistic liturgy " .
on september 27 , 2010 , public safety canada partnered with stop.think.connect , a coalition of non-profit , private sector , and government organizations dedicated to informing the general public on how to protect themselves online . on february 4 , 2014 , the government of canada launched the cyber security cooperation program . the program is a $ 1.5 million five-year initiative aimed at improving canada ’ s cyber systems through grants and contributions to projects in support of this objective . public safety canada aims to begin an evaluation of canada 's cyber security strategy in early 2015 . public safety canada administers and routinely updates the getcybersafe portal for canadian citizens , and carries out cyber security awareness month during october .
in addition , most grand lodges require the candidate to declare a belief in a supreme being . in a few cases , the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion . the form of freemasonry most common in scandinavia ( known as the swedish rite ) , for example , accepts only christians . at the other end of the spectrum , " liberal " or continental freemasonry , exemplified by the grand orient de france , does not require a declaration of belief in any deity , and accepts atheists ( a cause of discord with the rest of freemasonry ) .
but house was also being developed on ibiza , [ citation needed ] although no house artists or labels were coming from this tiny island at the time . by the mid-1980s a distinct balearic mix of house was discernible . [ citation needed ] several clubs such as amnesia with dj alfredo were playing a mix of rock , pop , disco and house . these clubs , fueled by their distinctive sound and ecstasy , began to have an influence on the british scene . by late 1987 , djs such as trevor fung , paul oakenfold and danny rampling were bringing the ibiza sound to uk clubs such as the haçienda in manchester , and in london clubs such as shoom in southwark , heaven , future and spectrum .
plant responses to climate and other environmental changes can inform our understanding of how these changes affect ecosystem function and productivity . for example , plant phenology can be a useful proxy for temperature in historical climatology , and the biological impact of climate change and global warming . palynology , the analysis of fossil pollen deposits in sediments from thousands or millions of years ago allows the reconstruction of past climates . estimates of atmospheric co2 concentrations since the palaeozoic have been obtained from stomatal densities and the leaf shapes and sizes of ancient land plants . ozone depletion can expose plants to higher levels of ultraviolet radiation-b ( uv-b ) , resulting in lower growth rates . moreover , information from studies of community ecology , plant systematics , and taxonomy is essential to understanding vegetation change , habitat destruction and species extinction .
everton hold the record for the most seasons in england 's top tier ( division one/premier league ) , at 111 seasons out of 114 as of 2014–15 ( the club played in division 2 in 1930–31 and from 1951–54 ) . they are one of seven teams to have played all 22 seasons of the premier league since its inception in august 1992 – the others being arsenal , aston villa , chelsea , liverpool , manchester united , and tottenham hotspur . everton against aston villa is the most played fixture in england 's top flight , as of the 2012–13 season the two founder members of the football league have played a record 196 league games .
television broadcasting in hyderabad began in 1974 with the launch of doordarshan , the government of india 's public service broadcaster , which transmits two free-to-air terrestrial television channels and one satellite channel . private satellite channels started in july 1992 with the launch of star tv . satellite tv channels are accessible via cable subscription , direct-broadcast satellite services or internet-based television . hyderabad 's first dial-up internet access became available in the early 1990s and was limited to software development companies . the first public internet access service began in 1995 , with the first private sector internet service provider ( isp ) starting operations in 1998 . in 2015 , high-speed public wifi was introduced in parts of the city .
opponents argue that the death penalty is not an effective means of deterring crime , risks the execution of the innocent , is unnecessarily barbaric in nature , cheapens human life , and puts a government on the same base moral level as those criminals involved in murder . furthermore , some opponents argue that the arbitrariness with which it is administered and the systemic influence of racial , socio-economic , geographic , and gender bias on determinations of desert make the current practice of capital punishment immoral and illegitimate .
arsenal ladies are the women 's football club affiliated to arsenal . founded in 1987 , they turned semi-professional in 2002 and are managed by clare wheatley . arsenal ladies are the most successful team in english women 's football . in the 2008–09 season , they won all three major english trophies – the fa women 's premier league , fa women 's cup and fa women 's premier league cup , and , as of 2009 , were the only english side to have won the uefa women 's cup , having done so in the 2006–07 season as part of a unique quadruple . the men 's and women 's clubs are formally separate entities but have quite close ties ; arsenal ladies are entitled to play once a season at the emirates stadium , though they usually play their home matches at boreham wood .
biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources . a significant proportion of drugs are derived , directly or indirectly , from biological sources : at least 50 % of the pharmaceutical compounds on the us market are derived from plants , animals , and micro-organisms , while about 80 % of the world population depends on medicines from nature ( used in either modern or traditional medical practice ) for primary healthcare . only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for medical potential . biodiversity has been critical to advances throughout the field of bionics . evidence from market analysis and biodiversity science indicates that the decline in output from the pharmaceutical sector since the mid-1980s can be attributed to a move away from natural product exploration ( " bioprospecting " ) in favor of genomics and synthetic chemistry , indeed claims about the value of undiscovered pharmaceuticals may not provide enough incentive for companies in free markets to search for them because of the high cost of development ; meanwhile , natural products have a long history of supporting significant economic and health innovation . marine ecosystems are particularly important , although inappropriate bioprospecting can increase biodiversity loss , as well as violating the laws of the communities and states from which the resources are taken .
british post-punk entered the 1980s with support from members of the critical community—american critic greil marcus characterised " britain 's postpunk pop avant-garde " in a 1980 rolling stone article as " sparked by a tension , humour and sense of paradox plainly unique in present day pop music " —as well as media figures such as bbc dj john peel , while several groups , such as pil and joy division , achieved some success in the popular charts . the network of supportive record labels that included industrial , fast , e.g. , mute , axis/4ad and glass continued to facilitate a large output of music , by artists such as the raincoats , essential logic , killing joke , the teardrop explodes , and the psychedelic furs .
the birth of native estonian literature was in 1810 to 1820 when the patriotic and philosophical poems by kristjan jaak peterson were published . peterson , who was the first student at the then german-language university of dorpat to acknowledge his estonian origin , is commonly regarded as a herald of estonian national literature and considered the founder of modern estonian poetry . his birthday on march 14 is celebrated in estonia as the mother tongue day . a fragment from peterson 's poem " kuu " expresses the claim reestablishing the birthright of the estonian language :
the enlightenment took hold in most european countries , often with a specific local emphasis . for example , in france it became associated with anti-government and anti-church radicalism while in germany it reached deep into the middle classes and where it expressed a spiritualistic and nationalistic tone without threatening governments or established churches . government responses varied widely . in france , the government was hostile , and the philosophes fought against its censorship , sometimes being imprisoned or hounded into exile . the british government for the most part ignored the enlightenment 's leaders in england and scotland , although it did give isaac newton a knighthood and a very lucrative government office .
the longmen shan fault system is situated in the eastern border of the tibetan plateau and contains several faults . this earthquake ruptured at least two imbricate structures in longmen shan fault system , i.e . the beichuan fault and the guanxian–anxian fault . in the epicentral area , the average slip in beichuan fault was about 3.5 metres ( 11 ft ) vertical , 3.5 metres ( 11 ft ) horizontal-parallel to the fault , and 4.8 metres ( 16 ft ) horizontal-perpendicular to the fault . in the area about 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northeast of the epicenter , the surface slip on beichuan fault was almost purely dextral strike-slip up to about 3 metres ( 9.8 ft ) , while the average slip in guanxian–anxian fault was about 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) vertical and 2.3 metres ( 7 ft 7 in ) horizontal .
early work in molecular genetics suggested the model that one gene makes one protein . this model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mrnas are concatenated by trans-splicing .
professional wrestling in the u.s. tends to have a heavy focus on story building and the establishment of characters ( and their personalities ) . there is a story for each match , and even a longer story for successive matches . the stories usually contain characters like faces and heels , and less often antiheroes and tweeners . it is a " triumph " if the face wins , while it is a " tragedy " if the heel wins . the characters usually have strong and sharp personalities , with examples like doink the clown , whose personality is melodramatic , slapstick and fantastical . the opposition between faces and heels is very intense in the story , and the heels may even attack the faces during tv interviews . the relationship between different characters can also be very complex .
also in 1931 , hayek critiqued keynes 's treatise on money ( 1930 ) in his " reflections on the pure theory of mr. j. m. keynes " and published his lectures at the lse in book form as prices and production . unemployment and idle resources are , for keynes , caused by a lack of effective demand ; for hayek , they stem from a previous , unsustainable episode of easy money and artificially low interest rates . keynes asked his friend piero sraffa to respond . sraffa elaborated on the effect of inflation-induced " forced savings " on the capital sector and about the definition of a " natural " interest rate in a growing economy . others who responded negatively to hayek 's work on the business cycle included john hicks , frank knight , and gunnar myrdal . kaldor later wrote that hayek 's prices and production had produced " a remarkable crop of critics " and that the total number of pages in british and american journals dedicated to the resulting debate " could rarely have been equalled in the economic controversies of the past . "
according to chen , the ming officer of hezhou ( modern day linxia ) informed the hongwu emperor that the general situation in dbus and gtsang " was under control , " and so he suggested to the emperor that he offer the second phagmodru ruler , jamyang shakya gyaltsen , an official title . according to the records of the founding emperor , the hongwu emperor issued an edict granting the title " initiation state master " to sagya gyaincain , while the latter sent envoys to the ming court to hand over his jade seal of authority along with tribute of colored silk and satin , statues of the buddha , buddhist scriptures , and sarira .
new sequencing technologies , such as massive parallel sequencing have also opened up the prospect of personal genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool , as pioneered by manteia predictive medicine . a major step toward that goal was the completion in 2007 of the full genome of james d. watson , one of the co-discoverers of the structure of dna .
predation is a biological interaction where a predator ( a heterotroph that is hunting ) feeds on its prey ( the organism that is attacked ) . predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them , but the act of predation almost always results in the death of the prey . the other main category of consumption is detritivory , the consumption of dead organic matter . it can at times be difficult to separate the two feeding behaviours , for example , where parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on its decaying corpse . selective pressures imposed on one another has led to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator , resulting in various antipredator adaptations .
the trans-alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels ( 330,000 m3 ) of crude oil per day , more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states . additionally , substantial coal deposits are found in alaska 's bituminous , sub-bituminous , and lignite coal basins . the united states geological survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet ( 2,420 km3 ) of undiscovered , technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope . alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers . large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well .
in the instance when the presidency and both houses of congress are controlled by one party , the speaker normally assumes a lower profile and defers to the president . for that situation the house minority leader can play the role of a de facto " leader of the opposition " , often more so than the senate minority leader , due to the more partisan nature of the house and the greater role of leadership . minority leaders who have played prominent roles in opposing the incumbent president have included gerald ford , richard gephardt , nancy pelosi , and john boehner .
years later , kaunitz kept trying to establish france 's alliance with austria . he tried as hard as he could for austria to not get entangled in hanover 's political affairs , and was even willing to trade austrian netherlands for france 's aid in recapturing silesia . frustrated by this decision and by the dutch republic 's insistence on neutrality , britain soon turned to russia . on september 30 , 1755 , britain pledged financial aid to russia in order to station 50,000 troops on the livonian-lithunian border , so they could defend britain 's interests in hanover immediately . besthuzev , assuming the preparation was directed against prussia , was more than happy to obey the request of the british . unbeknownst to the other powers , king george ii also made overtures to the prussian king ; frederick , who began fearing the austro-russian intentions , and was excited to welcome a rapprochement with britain . on january 16 , 1756 , the convention of westminster was signed wherein britain and prussia promised to aid one another in order to achieve lasting peace and stability in europe .
some researchers believe that the first russian settlement in alaska was established in the 17th century . according to this hypothesis , in 1648 several koches of semyon dezhnyov 's expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement . this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin , who had visited alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river , populated by " bearded men " who " pray to the icons " . some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river .
in 1904 , a british expedition to tibet , spurred in part by a fear that russia was extending its power into tibet as part of the great game , invaded the country , hoping that negotiations with the 13th dalai lama would be more effective than with chinese representatives . when the british-led invasion reached tibet on december 12 , 1903 , an armed confrontation with the ethnic tibetans resulted in the massacre of chumik shenko , which resulted in 600 fatalities amongst the tibetan forces , compared to only 12 on the british side . afterwards , in 1904 francis younghusband imposed a treaty known as the treaty of lhasa , which was subsequently repudiated and was succeeded by a 1906 treaty signed between britain and china .
on 1 november 1956 the states of india were reorganised by language . hyderabad state was split into three parts , which were merged with neighbouring states to form the modern states of maharashtra , karnataka and andhra pradesh . the nine telugu- and urdu-speaking districts of hyderabad state in the telangana region were merged with the telugu-speaking andhra state to create andhra pradesh , with hyderabad as its capital . several protests , known collectively as the telangana movement , attempted to invalidate the merger and demanded the creation of a new telangana state . major actions took place in 1969 and 1972 , and a third began in 2010 . the city suffered several explosions : one at dilsukhnagar in 2002 claimed two lives ; terrorist bombs in may and august 2007 caused communal tension and riots ; and two bombs exploded in february 2013 . on 30 july 2013 the government of india declared that part of andhra pradesh would be split off to form a new telangana state , and that hyderabad city would be the capital city and part of telangana , while the city would also remain the capital of andhra pradesh for no more than ten years . on 3 october 2013 the union cabinet approved the proposal , and in february 2014 both houses of parliament passed the telangana bill . with the final assent of the president of india in june 2014 , telangana state was formed .
greek surnames were widely in use by the 9th century supplanting the ancient tradition of using the father ’ s name , however greek surnames are most commonly patronymics . commonly , greek male surnames end in -s , which is the common ending for greek masculine proper nouns in the nominative case . exceptionally , some end in -ou , indicating the genitive case of this proper noun for patronymic reasons . although surnames in mainland greece are static today , dynamic and changing patronymic usage survives in middle names where the genitive of father 's first name is commonly the middle name ( this usage having been passed on to the russians ) . in cyprus , by contrast , surnames follow the ancient tradition of being given according to the father ’ s name . finally , in addition to greek-derived surnames many have latin , turkish and italian origin .
von neumann made fundamental contributions in exploration of problems in numerical hydrodynamics . for example , with robert d. richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves . a problem was that when computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems , they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity ( shock waves ) . the mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics . other well known contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution to blast waves , and the co-discovery of the znd detonation model of explosives .
zhejiang 's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries , textiles , chemical industries , food , and construction materials . in recent years zhejiang has followed its own development model , dubbed the " zhejiang model " , which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship , an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market , large public investments into infrastructure , and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export . as a result , zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces , and the " zhejiang spirit " has become something of a legend within china . however , some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable , in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities , and also a dead end , in that the myriad small businesses in zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries . the economic heart of zhejiang is moving from north zhejiang , centered on hangzhou , southeastward to the region centered on wenzhou and taizhou . the per capita disposable income of urbanites in zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan ( us $ 3,603 ) in 2009 , an annual real growth of 8.3 % . the per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan ( us $ 1,465 ) , a real growth of 8.1 % year-on-year . zhejiang 's nominal gdp for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan ( us $ 506 billion ) with a per capita gdp of 44,335 yuan ( us $ 6,490 ) . in 2009 , zhejiang 's primary , secondary , and tertiary industries were worth 116.2 billion yuan ( us $ 17 billion ) , 1.1843 trillion yuan ( us $ 173.4 billion ) , and 982.7 billion yuan ( us $ 143.9 billion ) respectively .
the bithynians were a thracian people living in northwest anatolia . after alexander 's conquests the region of bithynia came under the rule of the native king bas , who defeated calas , a general of alexander the great , and maintained the independence of bithynia . his son , zipoetes i of bithynia maintained this autonomy against lysimachus and seleucus i , and assumed the title of king ( basileus ) in 297 bce . his son and successor , nicomedes i , founded nicomedia , which soon rose to great prosperity , and during his long reign ( c. 278 – c. 255 bce ) , as well as those of his successors , the kingdom of bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of anatolia . nicomedes also invited the celtic galatians into anatolia as mercenaries , and they later turned on his son prusias i , who defeated them in battle . their last king , nicomedes iv , was unable to maintain himself against mithridates vi of pontus , and , after being restored to his throne by the roman senate , he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the roman republic ( 74 bce ) .
by may 14 , the ministry of civil affairs stated that 10.7 billion yuan ( approximately us $ 1.5 billion ) had been donated by the chinese public . houston rockets center yao ming , one of the country 's most popular sports icons , gave $ 214,000 and $ 71,000 to the red cross society of china . the association has also collected a total of $ 26 million in donations so far . other multinational firms located in china have also announced large amounts of donations .
congress often enacts statutes that grant broad rulemaking authority to federal agencies . often , congress is simply too gridlocked to draft detailed statutes that explain how the agency should react to every possible situation , or congress believes the agency 's technical specialists are best equipped to deal with particular fact situations as they arise . therefore , federal agencies are authorized to promulgate regulations . under the principle of chevron deference , regulations normally carry the force of law as long as they are based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes .
as of 2013 , the global advertising agencies of omnicom group and interpublic group , both based in manhattan , had combined annual revenues of approximately us $ 21 billion , reflecting new york city 's role as the top global center for the advertising industry , which is metonymously referred to as " madison avenue " . the city 's fashion industry provides approximately 180,000 employees with $ 11 billion in annual wages .
like maradona , ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for internazionale . however , new heroes emerged , such as luís figo , patrick kluivert , luis enrique and rivaldo , and the team won a copa del rey and la liga double in 1998 . in 1999 , the club celebrated its centenari , winning the primera división title , and rivaldo became the fourth barcelona player to be awarded european footballer of the year . despite this domestic success , the failure to emulate real madrid in the champions league led to van gaal and núñez resigning in 2000 .
schwarzenegger 's net worth had been conservatively estimated at $ 100– $ 200 million . after separating from his wife , maria shriver , in 2011 , it has been estimated that his net worth has been approximately $ 400 million , and even as high as $ 800 million , based on tax returns he filed in 2006 . over the years as an investor , he invested his bodybuilding and movie earnings in an array of stocks , bonds , privately controlled companies , and real estate holdings worldwide , making his net worth as an accurate estimation difficult to calculate , particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to economic recessions in the u.s. and europe since the late 2000s . in june 1997 , schwarzenegger spent $ 38 million of his own money on a private gulfstream jet . schwarzenegger once said of his fortune , " money does n't make you happy . i now have $ 50 million , but i was just as happy when i had $ 48 million . " he has also stated , " i 've made many millions as a businessman many times over . "
the movement to translate english and european texts transformed the arabic and ottoman turkish languages , and new words , simplified syntax , and directness came to be valued over the previous convolutions . educated arabs and turks in the new professions and the modernized civil service expressed skepticism , writes christopher de bellaigue , " with a freedom that is rarely witnessed today ... . no longer was legitimate knowledge defined by texts in the religious schools , interpreted for the most part with stultifying literalness . it had come to include virtually any intellectual production anywhere in the world . " one of the neologisms that , in a way , came to characterize the infusion of new ideas via translation was " darwiniya " , or " darwinism " .
the lophotrochozoa , evolved within protostomia , include two of the most successful animal phyla , the mollusca and annelida . the former , which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species , includes animals such as snails , clams , and squids , and the latter comprises the segmented worms , such as earthworms and leeches . these two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae , but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented . now , this is generally considered convergent evolution , owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla . the lophotrochozoa also include the nemertea or ribbon worms , the sipuncula , and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth , called a lophophore . these were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates . but it now appears that the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic , with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids . they include the brachiopoda or lamp shells , which are prominent in the fossil record , the entoprocta , the phoronida , and possibly the bryozoa or moss animals .
by the late 1990s , blue leds became widely available . they have an active region consisting of one or more ingan quantum wells sandwiched between thicker layers of gan , called cladding layers . by varying the relative in/ga fraction in the ingan quantum wells , the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber . aluminium gallium nitride ( algan ) of varying al/ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet leds , but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of ingan/gan blue/green devices . if un-alloyed gan is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers , the device will emit near-ultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around 365 nm . green leds manufactured from the ingan/gan system are far more efficient and brighter than green leds produced with non-nitride material systems , but practical devices still exhibit efficiency too low for high-brightness applications .

more than 200 newspapers and 350 consumer magazines have an office in the city , and the publishing industry employs about 25,000 people . two of the three national daily newspapers in the united states are new york papers : the wall street journal and the new york times , which has won the most pulitzer prizes for journalism . major tabloid newspapers in the city include : the new york daily news , which was founded in 1919 by joseph medill patterson and the new york post , founded in 1801 by alexander hamilton . the city also has a comprehensive ethnic press , with 270 newspapers and magazines published in more than 40 languages . el diario la prensa is new york 's largest spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation . the new york amsterdam news , published in harlem , is a prominent african american newspaper . the village voice is the largest alternative newspaper .
topographically , a remarkable feature of galicia is the presence of many firth-like inlets along the coast , estuaries that were drowned with rising sea levels after the ice age . these are called rías and are divided into the smaller rías altas ( " high rías " ) , and the larger rías baixas ( " low rías " ) . the rías altas include ribadeo , foz , viveiro , barqueiro , ortigueira , cedeira , ferrol , betanzos , a coruña , corme e laxe and camariñas . the rías baixas , found south of fisterra , include corcubión , muros e noia , arousa , pontevedra and vigo . the rías altas can sometimes refer only to those east of estaca de bares , with the others being called rías medias ( " intermediate rías " ) .
he was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics , in the development of functional analysis , a principal member of the manhattan project and the institute for advanced study in princeton ( as one of the few originally appointed ) , and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata , the universal constructor and the digital computer . he published 150 papers in his life ; 60 in pure mathematics , 20 in physics , and 60 in applied mathematics . his last work , an unfinished manuscript written while in the hospital , was later published in book form as the computer and the brain .
many annual events celebrate the diverse cultures of houston . the largest and longest running is the annual houston livestock show and rodeo , held over 20 days from early to late march , is the largest annual livestock show and rodeo in the world . another large celebration is the annual night-time houston pride parade , held at the end of june . other annual events include the houston greek festival , art car parade , the houston auto show , the houston international festival , and the bayou city art festival , which is considered to be one of the top five art festivals in the united states .
the paleozoic spanned from roughly 541 to 252 million years ago ( ma ) and is subdivided into six geologic periods ; from oldest to youngest they are the cambrian , ordovician , silurian , devonian , carboniferous and permian . geologically , the paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called pannotia and at the end of a global ice age . throughout the early paleozoic , the earth 's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents . toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called pangaea , which included most of the earth 's land area .
the eusocial insects build nest , guard eggs , and provide food for offspring full-time ( see eusociality ) . most insects , however , lead short lives as adults , and rarely interact with one another except to mate or compete for mates . a small number exhibit some form of parental care , where they will at least guard their eggs , and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood , and possibly even feeding them . another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest ( a burrow or an actual construction , either of which may be simple or complex ) , store provisions in it , and lay an egg upon those provisions . the adult does not contact the growing offspring , but it nonetheless does provide food . this sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps .
in 2013 , houston was identified as the # 1 u.s. city for job creation by the u.s. bureau of statistics after it was not only the first major city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn , but after the crash , more than two jobs were added for every one lost . economist and vice president of research at the greater houston partnership patrick jankowski attributed houston 's success to the ability of the region 's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes . furthermore , jankowski stated that " more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated , expanded or started new businesses in houston " between 2008 and 2010 , and this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low . also in 2013 , houston again appeared on forbes ' list of best places for business and careers .
konbaung kings extended restored toungoo 's administrative reforms , and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion . for the first time in history , the burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire irrawaddy valley . the evolution and growth of burmese literature and theatre continued , aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era ( half of all males and 5 % of females ) . nonetheless , the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of british colonialism .
the palace , like windsor castle , is owned by the crown estate . it is not the monarch 's personal property , unlike sandringham house and balmoral castle . many of the contents from buckingham palace , windsor castle , kensington palace , and st james 's palace are part of the royal collection , held in trust by the sovereign ; they can , on occasion , be viewed by the public at the queen 's gallery , near the royal mews . unlike the palace and the castle , the purpose-built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection . it occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in world war ii . the palace 's state rooms have been open to the public during august and september and on selected dates throughout the year since 1993 . the money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of windsor castle after the 1992 fire devastated many of its state rooms . 476,000 people visited the palace in the 2014–15 financial year .
russell 's ministry , though whig , was not favoured by the queen . she found particularly offensive the foreign secretary , lord palmerston , who often acted without consulting the cabinet , the prime minister , or the queen . victoria complained to russell that palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge , but palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative , despite her repeated remonstrances . it was only in 1851 that palmerston was removed after he announced the british government 's approval of president louis-napoleon bonaparte 's coup in france without consulting the prime minister . the following year , president bonaparte was declared emperor napoleon iii , by which time russell 's administration had been replaced by a short-lived minority government led by lord derby .
although the rivers and coast of this area were among the first places colonized by the portuguese , who set up trading posts in the 16th century , they did not explore the interior until the 19th century . the local african rulers in guinea , some of whom prospered greatly from the slave trade , controlled the inland trade and did not allow the europeans into the interior . they kept them in the fortified coastal settlements where the trading took place . african communities that fought back against slave traders also distrusted european adventurers and would-be settlers . the portuguese in guinea were largely restricted to the port of bissau and cacheu . a small number of european settlers established isolated farms along bissau 's inland rivers .
on 11 august , barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth european super cup by beating sevilla fc 5–4 in the 2015 uefa super cup . they ended the year with a 3–0 win over argentine club river plate in the 2015 fifa club world cup final on 20 december to win the trophy for a record third time , with suárez , messi and iniesta the top three players of the tournament . the fifa club world cup was barcelona 's 20th international title , a record only matched by egyptian club al ahly sc . by scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions , barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year , breaking real madrid 's record of 178 goals scored in 2014 .
victoria 's father was prince edward , duke of kent and strathearn , the fourth son of the reigning king of the united kingdom , george iii . until 1817 , edward 's niece , princess charlotte of wales , was the only legitimate grandchild of george iii . her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the duke of kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children . in 1818 he married princess victoria of saxe-coburg-saalfeld , a widowed german princess with two children—carl ( 1804–1856 ) and feodora ( 1807–1872 ) —by her first marriage to the prince of leiningen . her brother leopold was princess charlotte 's widower . the duke and duchess of kent 's only child , victoria , was born at 4.15 a.m. on 24 may 1819 at kensington palace in london .
with the continued miniaturization of computing resources , and advancements in portable battery life , portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s . the same developments that spurred the growth of laptop computers and other portable computers allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular phones . these so-called smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and have become the dominant computing device on the market , with manufacturers reporting having shipped an estimated 237 million devices in 2q 2013 .
in 1219 pope honorius iii invited saint dominic and his companions to take up residence at the ancient roman basilica of santa sabina , which they did by early 1220 . before that time the friars had only a temporary residence in rome at the convent of san sisto vecchio which honorius iii had given to dominic circa 1218 intending it to become a convent for a reformation of nuns at rome under dominic 's guidance . in may 1220 at bologna the order 's first general chapter mandated that each new priory of the order maintain its own studium conventuale thus laying the foundation of the dominican tradition of sponsoring widespread institutions of learning . the official foundation of the dominican convent at santa sabina with its studium conventuale occurred with the legal transfer of property from honorius iii to the order of preachers on june 5 , 1222 . this studium was transformed into the order 's first studium provinciale by saint thomas aquinas in 1265 . part of the curriculum of this studium was relocated in 1288 at the studium of santa maria sopra minerva which in the 16th century world be transformed into the college of saint thomas ( latin : collegium divi thomæ ) . in the 20th century the college would be relocated to the convent of saints dominic and sixtus and would be transformed into the pontifical university of saint thomas aquinas , angelicum .
educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines . it is informed primarily by psychology , bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology . educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies , including instructional design , educational technology , curriculum development , organizational learning , special education and classroom management . educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences . in universities , departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education , possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks ( lucas , blazek , & raley , 2006 ) .
the fbi has been frequently depicted in popular media since the 1930s . the bureau has participated to varying degrees , which has ranged from direct involvement in the creative process of film or tv series development , to providing consultation on operations and closed cases . a few of the notable portrayals of the fbi on television are the 1993-2002 series the x-files , which concerned investigations into paranormal phenomena by five fictional special agents and the fictional counter terrorist unit ( ctu ) agency in the tv drama 24 , which is patterned after the fbi counterterrorism division . the 1991 movie point break is based on the true story of an undercover fbi agent who infiltrated a gang of bank robbers . the 1997 movie donnie brasco is based on the true story of undercover fbi agent joseph d. pistone infiltrating the mafia .
possibly as early as the second century ad , virgil 's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination . in what became known as the sortes vergilianae ( virgilian lots ) , passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions . in the 12th century , starting around naples but eventually spreading widely throughout europe , a tradition developed in which virgil was regarded as a great magician . legends about virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years , arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves . virgil 's legacy in medieval wales was such that the welsh version of his name , fferyllt or pheryllt , became a generic term for magic-worker , and survives in the modern welsh word for pharmacist , fferyllydd .
the ideas of the italian renaissance were slow to cross the alps into northern europe , but important artistic innovations were made also in the low countries . though not – as previously believed – the inventor of oil painting , jan van eyck was a champion of the new medium , and used it to create works of great realism and minute detail . the two cultures influenced each other and learned from each other , but painting in the netherlands remained more focused on textures and surfaces than the idealized compositions of italy .
